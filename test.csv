I don't wanna see you yelling oof

Running 'round in yellow green and blue
Why you always such a noob
Walking round, acting brand new
I don't wanna see you yelling oof
But you ain't got a clue
Afk and lagging out too
Running 'round in yellow green and blue
Now i'm on the golden gun
Going for that arsenal dub
Somehow never got my builder's club
Newbie, i'm not an oder
Won't you ever understand
I only simp for builderman
Boy it's obvious that you're such a noob
Laggy internet that you barely move
And you love dying in murder mystery 2
Now i'm tired of you acting so confused
We play games we love and have fun with our free time
We've fallen before but we laugh in the meantime
Why you always such a noob
Walking round, acting brand new
I don't wanna see you yelling oof

Running 'round in yellow green and blue

I don't wanna see you yelling oof
But you ain't got a clue
Afk and lagging out too
Running 'round in yellow green and blue
So why's it saying you're online but you don't show up
We could stick to playing the blox as we grow up
If i could then i would give you all my robux
But i'm sorry i can only give you bobux
I'm talking anthro
Arsenal, winning every bloxy
Finding every key to escape from the piggy
Got a tycoon, now i'm spitting out money
Got a simulator full of bees making honey
We play games we love and have fun with our free time
We've fallen before but we laugh in the meantime
Why you always such a noob
Walking round, acting brand new
I don't wanna see you yelling oof
But you ain't got a clue
Afk and lagging out too
Running 'round in yellow green and blue

I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that santa's on his way -
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so i'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two

Many ways: ""merry christmas to you""

And Santa Claus is coming round
The Christmas snow is white on the ground
When old Santa gets into town
He'll be coming down the chimney, down

He'll have a big fat pack upon his back
And lots of goodies for you and for me
So leave a peppermint stick for old St. Nick
Hanging on the Christmas tree

On your own front door

Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing

Я сделал что-то не так (О-о), но я всегда прав (О-о)

Если я сказал тебе раз, то я не повторюсь дважды

Я живу, как в ""Thriller"", я выхожу только ночью
Она не трахается с ликёром, не любит быть выпившей
Она не пьёт Henny, только белое вино (Что она делает?)
Открыл пробку в новом Pinot Grigio (Да)
Подъехал на Porsche с причудливой шлюхой (Зум)
Паркую Porsche и подъезжаю на Lambo (Хмф)
Я выпрыгиваю, Майор Пейн, раскачиваю камуфляж (Да сэр)
Думаю она милая, заставляю её трахаться, дай её мужчине идти (Она милая)
Люблю стрелять, зажигать тебя, сука, я Рембо

The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh, baby, I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinkin' 'bout her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats

And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Hanging on to a girl to just rub it in

And baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
Let him take you on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own

[Verse 1]
Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves (Oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathing fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be bigger than yours

[Chorus]
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own

[Verse 2]
Disobey me, then baby, it's off with your head
Gonna change it and make it a world you won't forget (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathing fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But I'm stronger than I ever was before

[Chorus]
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast

Everybody knows my name now
But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seein' somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killin' me now

[Chorus]
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely
[Post-Chorus]
I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely

[Verse 2]
Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid

[Chorus]
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely

A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
[Verse 2]
Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill

But I wouldn't have it any other way

Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong

But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby fuckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I fuck her with my chains on
And she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go

[Verse 1]
Stop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden, and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again
[Pre-Chorus]
We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow

This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I

We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow

Still stackin' my chips, hoes
Higher than Shaq on his tiptoes
Atop the Empire State Buildin'
This shit is like child's play, childrеn
I will anni-nihilate, kill them
I'll fuck around and pile еight million
Dead little juveniles, wait, chill, then
I'll await my trial date 'til then (What?)
Ain't nothin' you say could ever trump (Nah), mic, pencil get killed (Yeah)
If you're hypersensitive, I wasn't referencin' the vice president, chill (Chill)
I mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill, violence but with skill
That's why I hence when I write ends up with the mic and pencil gettin' killed (Haha, yeah, hold up)
And I'm still ride or die for the squad (Yeah)
So you know which side that I'm on
If a battle line's ever drawn, but if I get involved
It'll be like K9's in a brawl
But not similar to Mike Vick at all
'Cause even if I don't have a dog in the fight
They ain't never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog (Fight in the dog)
Got stripes like a tiger, so you might get mauled, a mic in the palms
Like claws, I can swing right for your jaw
And rip it off with one swipe of the paw

Every year, you drop the ball like Times Square
My hair trigger whenever I get an idea's
Like, fuck, now my name rings out like a sponge mop
And my drip was a drop
In the bucket, so that gun shot
You just heard just now in that one spot
Just came from the nine mil' that I just got
That's big bucks and I got a full money clip and I'm loaded
I ain't even mean to go the fuck off
And I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate
Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy
I'm hoping a little codeine'll get me OD'in'
Woah, everything is slow, I begin to floating
I know that I'm getting loaded, the pen exploded
Hiroshima with the flows, a utopia
With the dope, I'm an OG, I'm like the G.O.A.T.​
Here to get your goat little bit of sodium, it's assault (A salt)
When I'm at the podium, at your throat, holy camoly
I'm in the zone with the shit I'm on
Get Imodium and a commode because nobody's even close
You're petroleum to plutonium, you're a phony
I'm at the crib with your ho
Got her at the pole like voting with no clothing
Stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating
I've got my nose in the air like a Boeing
Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her
So I took a little lick of a Klonopin at dinner
Then I hit her with the motherfucking ottoman and bit her
Then I shot her in the liver, delivered her to the bottom of the river (Dope)
But I'm probably gon' jump in the water with her
With a wad of money 'cause I got a lot of it
And when it come to drippin', I be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour
Never runnin' out of either one of 'em, I gotta get it 'cause

Sweatpants, t-shirt, in her comfy chair, hmm
Her hair in a bun, one hand on a mug
And the other one’s playin' snare
To a George Strait vinyl, that yes-or-no line will get her close
But I don't think she can understand
Just how far I’ve been lettin' my heart fall
But what's in my head

Build a little house out on some hand-me-down land
Find a little island where we go to get tan
I bet we take our kids down there one day
And I know she wouldn't mind if I
Did a little somethin' like find a flight
Overnight to paradise and leave tonight
And I'ma put a diamond on her hand

Asked her mama for permission and her daddy for her hand

A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good

Maybe a baby or a couple by now

And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know

Of how his little girl turned out

Go drinkin', same friends on Friday
Bought a few acres, couple roads off the highway
Guess you never saw things my way anyway

If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
While I was gone, I would've asked you
It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me

[Chorus]
So we could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
[Verse 2]
I parkеd my car right between the Methodist
And thе school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me

[Chorus]
We could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

[Bridge]
Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving
And I'll be yours for the weekend

2 AM at a Broadway bar
ساعت 2 بامداد تو یه بار تو خیابون برادوی
She's puttin' her number in my phone (Broadway girls alone)
شماره اش رو میزنه تو گوشیم (دخترای تنهای اهل برادوی)
Two Bud Lights deep, and she's sayin' things she don't mean
دوتا بطری آبجو بادلایت تا آخر خورده شده،  و چیزایی میگه که منظوری نداره
And you know
و میدونی که

[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
I met her down at Aldean's
تو رستوان بار ""اَلدنز نشویل"" دیدمش
She said that she saw me walkin' in about a mile away
گفت که حدود یک مایل دورتر من رو در حال قدم زدن دید
Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away
پسر خاله ام ""بین"" فقط میخواست تلفنش رو ازش بگیره (تا ازم فیلم نگیره) و همین لبخندش رو از بین بر
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
گفت زیادی مست و دیوونه ام، نحوه رقصیدنم رو دوست نداره
I said, ""You don't have to join in,"" she said she'd take a chance
گفتم: مجبور نیستی بهم ملحق بشی. گفت شانسشو امتحان میکنه
I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down
از وقتی که نقشه ام شکست خورد یه جورایی دیوونه بودم
I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found
یه جورایی گم شدم، و این چیزی بود که فهمیدم
Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around
دخترای مثل تو فقط میخوان من رو دور بزنن، دور بزنن، دور بزنن

Oh, there's two things that you'rе gonna find out
اوه، دوتا چیز هست که قراره بفهمی
They don't love you and they only lovе you right now

If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
اگه زرنگ بودم، میموندم خونه
And leave them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
و دخترای اهل برادوی رو تنها میذاشتم (تنهاشون میذاشتم، تنهاشون میذاشتم)

They on me, they tryna finesse me
مهمون منن، سعی میکنن زرنگی کنن
They see me with Morgan and know that I rap
منو با ""مرگان"" دیدن و میدونن رپ میکنم
My horse is Porsches, turnin' me on
اسب من (ماشینم) پورشه، بهم توجه میکنن
I jump on a horse, she get on the back
پریدم رو یه اسب، اونم نشست پشتم
I went to the bar to go buy her a drink
رفتم بار تا واسش یه نوشیدنی بگیرم
She listen to P!nk, she told me she not into rap
بهم گفت رپ دوست نداره، آهنگ های ""پینک"" رو گوش میده
I can't run out of money
نمیتونم بی پول بشم (معنی دوم: نمیتونم بدون پول ادامه بدم)
The trenches love me forever
محله های فقیرو خلافکار همیشه دوستم دارن
They treat me like Ed in London
مثل ""اد شیرن"" تو لندن باهام رفتار میکنن
Take her to pool, then got a beer for nothin'
بردمش استخر، بعدش رایگان یه آبجو گرفتم
Tecovas boots, guitar, cigar, the bar
بوت های ""تیکوواس""، گیتار، سیگار، بار مشروب

Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose

All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say
""Rudolph with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then how the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee
""Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, you'll go down in history""

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
[Verse 2]
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

[Verse 3]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

Pra ficar à frente dessa porra (Gangue), bebi lean como se fosse licor
A vida nas ruas vai fazer com que você alcance Deus mais rápido (Yeah, gangue)

Eu sou o senhor derrubador dе corpos, a Gangue do Massacre é a sequеstradora de almas
Não é uma F-150 normal, isso é uma Raptor, porra
Sem mentira, sou um mano da rua, não um rapper
O fuzil atingiu ele e ele virou uma putinha
Smith & Wesson, eu tô representando a Gangue 4L
A gente batizou mais manos do que o reverendo (Yeah)

E ele tá com o duplo-R conversível lá fora
Verifiquei o tempo e tá ficando realmente estranho lá fora
Eu vou lançar essa merda e fazer esses idiotas descerem igual um maldito—

Eu desprezo
Quando eu te vejo, é melhor deixar esse maldito orgulho de lado

A treta tá acontecendo, alerta de spoiler, esse cara morre

Few days before he turned 80
He was sitting out back in a rocker
He said ""what you been up to lately?""
I told him chasing a dollar
And in between sips of coffee
He poured this wisdom out
Said if you want my two cents on making a dollar count

[Chorus: Jordan Davis]
Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send some prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
’Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt
[Verse 2: Luke Bryan]
Before you get caught on that ladder
Let mе tell you what it's all about
Find you a few things that matter
That you can put a fеnce around
And then he laid it out

Buy dirt
Find the one you can’t live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground

To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow

Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Ich bin böse
Ich bin böse
Ich bin böse (EMKAY)
Ich bin böse (EMKAY, EMKAY)

[Hook: Nardo Wick]
Wer will mit mir rauchen?
Wer will mit mir rauchen?
Wer will mit mir rauchen?
Nigga, wer will mit mir rauchen?
Wer will mit mir rauchen?
Wer will mit mir rauchen?
Wer will mit mir rauchen?
Nigga, wer will mit mir rauchen?
[Part 1: Nardo Wick]
Wer will mit mir rauchen? Ich versuche, die Lunge eines Niggas zu zerstören
Sie sind wie, „Nardo, nimm die verdammten Waffen hoch“
Scheiß drauf, sag': „Großer Bruder, hol die Waffen raus“
Wenn es raucht, können wir Runden drehen, während die Sonne scheint
Mir fehlt es nie an etwas, ich tanke mit gezogener Pistole
Schrei raus, „Was ist passiert?“ Dann mach dich an die Arbeit, bis sie zu Ende ist
All diese Niggas verstecken sich, und ich bin so, wo sind sie? Es macht keinen Spaß mehr
7.62s groß wie die Hölle, werden einem Nigga die Lunge aus dem Körper sprengen
Eins, zwei, drei, vier (Tret’ die Tür ein, leg dich auf den Boden)
Fünf, sechs, sieben, acht (Mach keinen Lärm, sonst fresse ich dein Gesicht)
Neuen, zehn, elf, wir sagen die Nummer nicht, wir hängen nicht mit Jakes
Ich werde vierzehn Niggas töten, wenn dreizehn Schlampen-Niggas spielen
Ich glaube, mein Draco könnte schwul sein (Wieso?), denn er bläst Niggas
Ich habe gerade einen brandneuen Lolli bekommen, das ist ein Four-Nickel
Nennt mich Nardo Ja-Mann, ich kenne nicht einen Nigga
Du kannst deinen besten Mann schicken, du wirst deinen besten Hitter verlieren

[Bridge: Nardo Wick & Lil Durk]
Was zum Fick ist das?

Ich bin am Arsch, wenn ich Opps sehe, vergesse ich, dass ich rappe (Ja, tue ich)
Ich bin immer dabei, egal, wo ich bin, das habe ich von der 'Raq gelernt
Er wird alles trinken, was ihm ein Nigga verkauft, nur um zu sagen, dass er high ist
Wenn ein Nigga stirbt, sagen sie: „Er war nicht mal bei dem Scheiß dabei“ (Er ging)
Die Notaufnahme wird euch immer anlügen, wenn ein Nigga stirbt (Wahr)
Sagen, dass ein Nigga stabil ist, nur um euch ruhig zu halten (Los geht’s)
Bronem stampft ihn
Tu besser, was Nardo sagt, denn Nigga sterben beim Tanken (Boom)
Warum tust du so, als wäre das etwas Exklusives? Schlampe, das ist ein öffentlicher Arsch (Öffentlicher Arsch)
Kann kein Nigga, mit dem wir nicht ficken, vorbeikommen, stampfen wir ihn
Nardo spricht, schleich dich aus dem Schnitt, wir mögen pscht, pscht
Nardo spricht, fang ihn, bevor er wegläuft, die Pistole macht pscht, pscht (Grrah)
Ey, wen hast du getötet? Du redest ständig, als wäre es eine Übung (Gang)
Wir werden dich nüchtern töten, wer hat dir gesagt, dass ich eine Pille brauche? Gang

Ein echter Stepper, ich lege meinen Zeh auf diesen Jungen
Du Mickey Mouse, Schlampe, du hast den Jungen verpetzt
Alle meine Waffen haben einen Schalter, denn ich bin verdammt reich
Ich verfasse keine Tweets oder werde nicht handgreiflich, lasse mich wegen deinem Scheiß abknallen
Alte Niggas, die ständig versuchen zu dissen, sollen sich von meinem Schwanz verpissen
Wir erwischten ihn beim Verlassen des Bingos mit seiner Schlampe und schickten einen Blitzer
Nardo versucht, mit mir um den Stock zu streiten, er ist an der Reihe zu schießen
Ich kann nicht mal meine Opps in Scheiße wälzen, Pussys gibt es nicht
Eins, zwei, drei, vier Niggas sind sauer, dass ich die Hure gefickt habe
Fünf, sechs, sieben, acht Pussys, die mit diesem K getroffen wurden

100K-Checks in der Post
Lege das nur für die Kaution zurück
All das Crack, das wir verkauft haben

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there

You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough

So casually cruel in the name of being honest

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it

Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

Gotta prove it to myself that I'm on top of shit
And you would never know a god without the goddesses

I could smile and jiggle it 'til his pockets empty
I could be the CEO, just look at Robyn Fenty
And I'ma be there for you 'cause you on my team, girl
Don't ever think you ain't hella these niggas dream girl

Since I made up twenty-five million on one of them days
Now these niggas bitin' my wave

Cashed out on a Jesus piece 'cause you know what it mean to me
Went to pull up at Sunday service in Bugattis
I call up Yeezy, I got new holy water

If I had you back (Back)
I wouldn't've did all that (That)

All I'm tryna see is your credit card, swipe it all for me
Get me what I want, I don't need it
Just CC me, just VV me, just that dick when I call (Dick when I call)
No more feelings involved, I done seen all I need to

Knowing you, you probably got your toes in the sand
At a bar on a beach in the sun somewhere
Knowing you, you got something cold in your hand
Chatting up a stranger without a care
Knowing you, you're still wild and free
And knowing you, you're probably way over me

[Chorus]
But God, we were so alive
I was a kid on a carnival ride
Holdin' my breath 'til the moment
When you were gonna leave me too soon
But I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good knowing you
[Verse 2]
Knowing you was a free-fall from a hundred thousand feet
When you don't even care where you land
And knowing you was the kind of rush that you feel
When you finally get to sit in with the band
And knowing you, you're still a tumbleweed
I only wish that you would tumble back to me

[Chorus]
But God, we were so alive
I was a kid on a carnival ride
Holdin' my breath 'til the moment

Put that on my mama, nigga, eight in the process
Niggas tryna tippy-toe through the progress
Tongue-tied when the truth is an object
What's the pros and the cons of this next check?
Wasn't nobody 'round, I was independent
In the '90s, sittin' bum with the windows tinted
Heard a bum got a strap in the party
Who the fuck let this **** in the party?
Beat 'em up, beat 'em up, beat 'em up, beat 'em up (Ah)
I was seein' double in the projects
Mad at myself, learned to put it to the side
Mama had to cater for the coupe
That we rode after school on the way to Popeyes
And niggas wanna play both sides

It's a headshot, Damien Kane, woo, them guys
Fuck around and bury two of them guys
I'm OD in Paris, I'm OD in France
I thought that I told you, I need the advance
Put down your IG and look through my lens
A million to grandma, who did I offend?
The girl of your dreams to me is a fan
I netted ten million and did a lil' dance
I'm fuckin' the world, I unzip my pants
My uncle G told me that I had a chance
So then I popped out and did it again
And did it again and did it again
I can not respect them, where did he begin?
Advice from the council, let nobody in
Been swervin' through rumors
Avoidin' the trends and duckin' the hoes
I'm duckin' the loonies that come with the shows
I'm grateful to Man-Man, he opened up doors
A bunk on the tour bus to come and compose
I reach to the stars on my tippy toes
This greatest success where most niggas fold
I tell you my past, that shit don't get old
But how could you ask like I don't be writin' my raps?
These critics got everyone tapped
You gotta relax, the city where nobody sleep
Just tap in and ask where I'm at, ho

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo
[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and
[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

[Verse 2]
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces
This kid's outrageous, he's buyin' them by the cases
Cause once I cop 'em, I gut 'em and switch the laces
They all purpose, ya heard me, kinda like my Daytons

This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
‘Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be

Now and then I get insecure from all the pain

So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone

You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad

Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

Ain't nothing you can say to me that
Can change my mind, I got to let you go now (Chill, baby)
And nothing will ever be the same, so just (Yeah)

And there's no more to explain to me, you know (Come on, now)

On the backstreet in the back seat of the Yukon

But patiently waitin' for you to tell a nigga to move on
Between me and you, we can find each other
Flyin' abroad in my private G-2
I ain't tryin' to G you, ma I'm tryin to see you
Bend over, you know how we do it, feet to shoulders
Bring heat to coldest night, so ferocious
Now you street promotin' the dick game is potent
'Cause in the bed a nigga go hard like Jordan
Sweat pourin', lovin' the way you be moanin'
Grippin' the sheets, lookin' at me lickin' at me

And there's a better day, a-comin, I'm hooked on your lovin'
Believe me, and when you hold my body
I know you need me, wait for me bay-bay
I've been goin half crazy for your love
And I was told that the sex, better than drugs

You know you're right and I'm the type
To pull up to your bumper, get your number
Baby, I can only help but wonder
What life would be without (my sweet baby)
And you're my baby (holla if you hear me)
Ah-ah-ah
You can understand that my love is pain
And how I feel in vain, it's just a woman thang
It's a man's world, but I understand
But there's still nothin' different, boy, stick to the plan

Woo
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
I saw Star Wars at least eight times
Had the Pac-Man pattern memorized
And I've seen the stuff they put inside
Stretch Armstrong, yeah
Oh, I was Roger Staubach in my backyard
Had a shoebox full of baseball cards
And a couple of Evel Knievel scars on my arm
Well, I was a kid when Elvis died
And my mama cried
[Chorus]
It was 1970-something
In the world that I grew up in
Farrah Fawcett hair-do days
Bell-bottoms and eight-track tapes
Lookin' back now I can see me
And oh, man, did I look cheesy
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Oh, it was 1970-something, yeah

[Verse 2]
It was the dawning of a new decade
We got our first microwave
And Dad broke down and finally shaved them old sideburns off
I took the stickers off of my Rubik's Cube
Watched MTV all afternoon
My first love was Daisy Duke in them cut-off jeans
A space shuttle fell out of the sky
And the whole world cried

[Chorus]
It was 1980-something
In the world that I grew up in
Skating rinks and black Trans Ams
Big hair and parachute pants
And lookin' back now I can see me
And oh, man, did I look cheesy
I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Oh, it was 1980-something

Now I'mma do this thing like it ain't done before
Never leave the game stranded, I had to give more
I'mma give you what you want, what you waitin' for?
Make the music that the people can't ignore
A lot of niggas is bitches, a lot of bitches be trippin'
A lot of them be wishin' that they was in my position
A lot of niggas be cowards and most chicks be chickens
Fuck 'bout the CLUCK! CLUCK! Eve ain't trippin'
Most dudes is okay (half of the rest ain't)
Talkin' 'bout what they wanna do (reality they can't)
Ask 'em what they life worth, watch 'em draw a blank
I really ain't got no interest if it don't involve the bank
Most of the time I'm nice to 'em (half the time I'm not)
It ain't nothin' new though (learned it from off the block)
People think I changed much 'cuz I'm livin' good
Now they get my voicemail, hear them callin' me rude?
Sometimes I feel bad (most of the time I don't)
'Cuz if I don't protect my shit (other niggas won't)
Some want me to neglect my shit (take it for a joke?!)
But I'm stayin' on the grind (never goin' back to broke)

Told y'all determined to win
You tryna enter through the back door?
Ain't nothin' happenin', this whole shit is my shit, bitch, and I'm the captain
Can't beat me, join me, baby, then get to clappin'
Bang it in ya whips to get ya neck snappin'
I know you hopin' that I rest so you can breathe
Stressed when we in the same places 'till I leave
Whisper to they friends, ""What they wanna do to me?""
Wish they could erase me, take away the air I breathe
And I feed 'cuz that shit only give me hunger pains
Never let you muhfuckas put out my flame
Ready for whatever, was trained to maintain
And I always been a savage 'bout the fame
Separate the girls from the women and the winnin'
Always knew the thrill was worth it from the beginnin'

This is for my number one
True baby for I adore

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
This is hard to say
I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
'Cause lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don’t feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you’re hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, ""You make me sick""
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart's half-broken and that’s hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
'Cause I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else
It's a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up
I can't let us self-destruct
[Chorus: Marc Dorsey]
Baby smile today
'Cause I been imaginin' more ways
I’m gon' luv U better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I’m gon' luv U better

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin’ all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL’s, baguettes and rings
Instead I walk around like I’m a king
And having you ain’t nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin’ you the lovin’ was good
Too busy frontin’ in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don’t ever let go
I’ma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don’t say no
'Cause I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well it’s time for the pain to go, ya’know

From this day forward I’ll never be the same

Wow, your hair got so long
Yeah, yeah, I love it, I really do
""Norma Jean"", ain't that the song we'd sing in the car?
Driving downtown, top down, making the rounds
Checking out the bands on Doheeney Avenue
Yeah, life throws you curves
But you learned to swerve
Me, I swung and I missed and the next thing ya know
I'm reminiscing
Dreaming old dreams, wishing old wishes
Like you would be back again
[Chorus]
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job
Guess not much has changed
Punch the clock, head for home
Check the phone, just in case
Go to bed, dream of you
That's what I'm doing these days
Yeah, that's what I'm doing

[Verse 2]
Someone told me after college, you ran off to Vegas
You married a rodeo cowboy
Wow, that ain't the girl I knew
Me, I've been a few places
Mostly here and there, once or twice
Still sortin' out life, but I'm doing alright
Yeah, it's good to see you too
Well, hey girl, you're late
And those planes, they don't wait
But if you ever come back around his sleepy old town
Promise me you'll stop in to see an old friend
And until then...

Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice
But I ain't Five-O, y'all know it's Nas, yo
Grey Goose and a whole lot of hydro
Only describe us as soldier survivors
Stay laced in the best, well-dressed
With finesse in a white tee, lookin' for wifey
Thug girl who fly and talks so nicely
Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive through the city, no doubt
But don't say my car's topless, say the titties is out
Newness, here's the anthem
Put your hand up that you shoot with, count your loot with
Push the pool stick in your new crib
Same hand that you hoop with, swing around like you stupid
King of the town? Yeah, I been that
You know I click-clack — where you and your mens at?
Do the Smurf, do the Wop, Baseball Bat
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back

They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up

Now get up off yo' ass like your seat's hot

Trunk of the car, we got the streetsweeper
Don't start none, won't be none
No reason for your mans to panic
You don't wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music defuse all the tension
Baller convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers and killers can move swift
Girls get close, you can feel where the tool's kept

Get money, leave the beef alone slowly

[Verse 1]
My brother said that I
Was rotten to the core
I was the youngest child
So I got by with more

[Verse 2]
I guess she was tired by
The time I came along
She'd laugh until she cried
I could do no wrong
She would always save me
Because I was her baby
[Verse 3]
I worked a factory in Ohio
A shrimp boat in the Bayou
I drove a truck in Birmingham
Turned 21 in Cincinnati
I called home to mom and daddy
I said ""Your boy is now a man""
She said ""I don't care if you're 80
You’ll always be my baby""

[Verse 4]
She loved that photograph
Of our whole family
She'd always point us out
For all her friends to see

[Verse 5]
That's Greg he's doing great
He really loves his job
And Ronnie with his 2 kids
How about that wife he's got
And that one's kind of crazy
But that one is my baby

[Verse 6]
I got a call in Alabama
Said come on home to Louisiana
And come as fast as you can fly
Cause your mamma really needs you
And says she's got to see you
She might not make it through the night
The whole way I drove 80
So she could see her baby

And cried just like a baby2Embed"

Some days it feels like 21
I'm still mad at you this morning
Coffee's ready if you want some
I've been up since five
Thinking about me and you
And I've got to tell you
The conclusion I've come to
I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up or get around to that

For now, you might as well forget it
Don't run your fingers through my hair
Yeah that's right, I'm being stubborn
No, I don't want to go back upstairs
I'm going to leave for work
Without a goodbye kiss
But as I'm driving off
Just remember this

We parked way out in a clearing in a grove and the night
Was hot as a coal burning' stove
We were cooking the gas we were had to last

Life was fast and the world was cruel

We were young and wild
We decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down
There would be no regrets

But on the way home that night

I don't know why I didn't come
I left you by the house of fun
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come

[Verse 2]
When I saw the break of day
I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand
[Refrain]
My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind
Forever

[Verse 3]
Out across the endless sea
I would die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone

[Refrain]
My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind
Forever

[Verse 4]
Something has to make you run
I don't know why I didn't come
I feel as empty as a drum
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come

Debates all day
Tell me what you think is going on
Two late
Heart break
Tell me what you think is going on
Whats going on
Whats going on
(Smilez)
And yo me and ms. thang
We were the perfect team
We had all the things all them other couples dreamed
Love, trust, good sex, and security
If you ever felt weak, smilez was your energy
Trips across seas
Showed you the finer things
No more burger king, it was fine dine cuisine
And if we never had it
I dont think it mattered
We were a class A like Nas and Illmatic
I was so decieved, i thought we had a thing
You used to blow my two way up with 1-4-3s
The l-o-v had me blind i wouldn't have seen
I trusted my friends, all they were yelling at me
How could you do me so wrong
I dont want get gone
I invested three years ma plus this song
Im so confused
Where to go how do i choose
I guess to find real love
I got to pay my dues

It seemed so good
Yo we used to chill in the hood
You made me feel that tingle in
My heart like nobody could
And all along we stood
When times is hard
Even before all this rap shit made me a star
When i was working two jobs just to survive
When i felt like killing my self
You kept me alive
What a pair
Me and you we was a match
Different tastes but you know opposites attract
By my side, held my head and kept me strong
Still trying to figure out where the hell we went wrong
I did what i can young cat being a man
Stayed whethered the storm when most would have ran
Too much pride, and you know men don't cry
Had to let you go even though it hurt inside
All by myself, now i had to turn to these rhymes
It's the only way i know to release my mind

(Repeat Chrous)

(Southstar)
Its been a while
Yea you know time goes fast
Let me tell you though, some things still dont pass
Sit back in the pad think, about the times we had
Try not to let it make me sad or make me mad
Im trying to move on with my life
The wound is healed
Yea im just speaking it real, im ready to feel
Ready to provide for my seed
A man now, bet you can't believe its me
(Smilez)
You ruined a good thing
And all of our dreams
Trying to lock me down a life time in the bing
Monitoring my calls
Piping at mah dogs
Shit, i never really understood the cause
My friends were your friends
Your friends were my friends
Your dough is my dough
My dough is my dough
Mono e mono
We'll foot this weather
And everybody that been through it, then sing it together
Come on

She's afraid that I might see
Those 5 extra pounds she talks about
Man, I don't know what she's talking about

She looks through magazines
With every page she dreams of
Looking like somebody else
I wish she wasn't so hard on herself

Then she falls asleep with just my t-shirt on
But even when her hair's messed up and her make-up's gone
Chorus

You can't hide Beautiful
You Can't hide wonderful
There's nothing that she has to do
It just comes natural
She makes it look easy
I love what she does to me
No way to disguise
The way that she shines
You can't hide beautiful, oh no

She can take a simple dress
Put it on and turn some heads
Man Everytime she moves she gets me
She doesn't even know she's sexy

And the way she thinks sometimes
Out of no where blows my mind
She makes me laugh and makes me dream
I love the way she looks at things

A little piece of heaven god gave to this world
She might think she's just an ordinary girl

Common Featuring Mary J. Blige,,False,89,82,82,Come Close To Me,3,2002-12-31,"Chapter 22: The Unreported Resistance LyricsIn the early 1990s, a writer for the New Republic magazine, reviewing with approval in the New York Times a book about the influence of dangerously unpatriotic elements among American intellectuals, warned his readers of the existence of ""a permanent adversarial culture"" in the United States

It was an accurate observation. Despite the political consensus of Democrats and Republicans in Washington which set limits on American reform, making sure that capitalism was in place, that national military strength was maintained, that wealth and power remained in the hands of a few, there were millions of Americans, probably tens of millions, who refused, either actively or silently, to go along. Their activities were largely unreported by the media. They constituted this ""permanent adversarial culture.""

The Democratic party was more responsive to these Americans, on whose votes it depended. But its responsiveness was limited by its own captivity to corporate interests, and its domestic reforms were severely limited by the system's dependency on militarism and war. Thus, President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty in the sixties became a victim of the war in Vietnam, and Jimmy Carter could not go far so long as he insisted on a huge outlay of money for the military, much of this to stockpile more nuclear weapons

As these limits became clear in the Carter years, a small but determined movement against nuclear arms began to grow. The pioneers were a tiny group of Christian pacifists who had been active against the Vietnam war (among them were a former priest, Philip Berrigan, and his wife, Elizabeth McAlister, a former nun). Again and again, members of this group would be arrested for engaging in nonviolent acts of dramatic protest against nuclear war at the Pentagon and the White House—trespassing on forbidden areas, pouring their own blood on symbols of the war machine

In 1980, small delegations of peace activists from all over the country maintained a series of demonstrations at the Pentagon, in which over a thousand people were arrested for acts of nonviolent civil disobedience

In September of that year, Philip Berrigan, his brother Daniel (the Jesuit priest and poet), Molly Rush (a mother of six), Anne Montgomery (a nun and counselor to young runaways and prostitutes in Manhattan), and four of their friends made their way past a guard in the General Electric Plant at King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, where nose cones for nuclear missiles were manufactured. They used sledgehammers to smash two of the nose cones and smeared their own blood over missile parts, blueprints, and furniture. Arrested, sentenced to years in prison, they said they were trying to set an example to do as the Bible suggested, to beat swords into plowshares
They pointed to the huge allocations of taxpayers' money to corporations producing weaponry: ""G.E. drains $3 million a day from the public treasury-an enormous larceny against the poor."" Before their trial (they came to be known as the Plowshares Eight), Daniel Berrigan had written in the Catholic Worker

I know of no sure way of predicting where things will go from there, whether others will hear and respond, or how quickly or slowly. Or whether the act will fail to vitalize others, will come to a grinding halt then and there, its actors stigmatized or dismissed as fools. One swallows dry and takes a chance

In fact, the movement did not come to a halt. Over the next decade, a national movement against nuclear weapons developed, from a small number of men and women willing to go to jail to make others stop and think to millions of Americans frightened at the thought of nuclear holocaust, indignant at the billions of dollars spent on weaponry while people were in need of life's necessities

Even the very Middle-American Pennsylvania jurors who convicted the Plowshares Eight showed remarkable sympathy with their actions. One juror, Michael DeRosa, told a reporter, ""I didn't think they really went to commit a crime. They went to protest."" Another, Mary Ann Ingram, said the jury argued about that: ""We . . . really didn't want to convict them on anything. But we had to because of the way the judge said the thing you can use is what you get under the law."" She added: ""These people are not criminals. Here are people who are trying to do some good for the country. But the judge said nuclear power wasn't the issue.""

Reagan's huge military budget was to provoke a national movement against nuclear weapons. In the election of 1980 that brought him into the Presidency, local referenda in three districts in western Massachusetts permitted voters to say whether they believed in a mutual Soviet-American halt to testing, production, and deployment of all nuclear weapons, and wanted Congress to devote those funds instead to civilian use. Two peace groups had worked for months on the campaign and all three districts approved the resolution (94,000 to 65,000), even those that voted for Reagan as President. Similar referenda received majority votes between 1978 and 1981 in San Francisco, Berkeley, Oakland, Madison, and Detroit

Women were in the forefront of the new antinuclear movement. Randall Forsberg, a young specialist in nuclear arms, organized the Council for a Nuclear Weapons Freeze, whose simple program—a mutual Soviet-American freeze on the production of new nuclear weapons—began to catch on throughout the country. Shortly after Reagan's election, two thousand women assembled in Washington, marched on the Pentagon, and surrounded it in a great circle, linking arms or stretching to hold the ends of brightly colored scarves. One hundred forty women were arrested for blocking the Pentagon entrance

A small group of doctors began to organize meetings around the country to teach citizens the medical consequences of nuclear war. They were the core of the Physicians for Social Responsibility, and Dr. Helen Caldicott, the group's president, became one of the most powerful and eloquent national leaders of the movement. At one of their public symposia, Howard Hiatt, dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, gave a graphic description of the results of one twenty-megaton nuclear bomb falling on Boston. Two million people would die. Survivors would be burned, blinded, crippled. In a nuclear war there would be 25 million severe burn cases in the nation, yet all existing facilities could take care of only 200 cases

At a national meeting of Catholic bishops early in the Reagan administration, the majority opposed any use of nuclear weapons. In November 1981, there were meetings on 151 college campuses around the country on the issue of nuclear war. And at local elections in Boston that month, a resolution calling for increased federal spending on social programs ""by reducing the amount of our tax dollars spent on nuclear weapons and programs of foreign intervention"" won a majority in every one of Boston's twenty-two wards, including both white and black working-class districts

On June 12, 1982, the largest political demonstration in the history of the country took place in Central Park, New York City. Close to a million people gathered to express their determination to bring an end to the arms race

Scientists who had worked on the atom bomb added their voices to the growing movement. George Kistiakowsky, a Harvard University chemistry professor who had worked on the first atomic bomb, and later was science adviser to President Eisenhower, became a spokesman for the disarmament movement. His last public remarks, before his death from cancer at the age of eighty-two, were in an editorial for the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists in December 1982. ""I tell you as my parting words: Forget the channels. There simply is not enough time left before the world explodes. Concentrate instead on organizing, with so many others of like mind, a mass movement for peace such as there has not been before.""

By the spring of 1983, the nuclear freeze had been endorsed by 368 city and county councils across the country, by 444 town meetings and 17 state legislatures, and by the House of Representatives. A Harris poll at this time indicated that 79 percent of the population wanted a nuclear freeze agreement with the Soviet Union. Even among evangelical Christians—a group of 40 million people presumed to be conservative and pro-Reagan—a Gallup poll sampling showed 60 percent favoring a nuclear freeze

A year after the great Central Park demonstration, there were over three thousand antiwar groups around the country. And the antinuclear feeling was being reflected in the culture-in books, magazine articles, plays, motion pictures. Jonathan Schells impassioned book against the arms race, The Fate of the Earth, became a national best-seller. A documentary film on the arms race made in Canada was forbidden to enter the country by the Reagan administration, but a federal court ordered it admitted

In less than three years, there had come about a remarkable change in public opinion. At the time of Reagan's election, nationalist feeling—drummed up by the recent hostage crisis in Iran and by the Russian invasion of Afghanistan—was strong; the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center found that only 12 percent of those it polled thought too much was being spent on arms. But when it took another poll in the spring of 1982, that figure rose to 32 percent. And in the spring of 1983, a New York Time/CBS News poll found that the figure had risen again, to 48 percent
Antimilitarist feeling expressed itself also in resistance to the draft. When President Jimmy Carter, responding to the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, called for the registration of young men for a military draft, more than 800,000 men (10 percent) failed to register. One mother wrote to the New York Time:

To the Editor: Thirty-six years ago I stood in front of the crematorium. The ugliest force in the world had promised itself that I should be removed from the cycle of life-that I should never know the pleasure of giving life. With great guns and great hatred, this force thought itself the equal of the force of lift

I survived the great guns, and with every smile of my son, they grow smaller. It is not for me, sir, to offer my son's blood as lubricant for the next generation of guns. I remove myself and my own from the cycle of death
Isabella Leitner

Former Nixon aide Alexander Haig warned, in an interview in the French journal Politique Internationale, that there might reappear in the U.S. the conditions that forced President Nixon to stop the draft. ""There is a Jane Fonda on every doorstep,"" he said

One of the young men who refused to register, James Peters, wrote an open letter to President Carter:

Dear Mr. President: On July 23, 1980, I ... am expected to report to my local post office for the purpose of registering with the Selective Service System. I hereby inform you, Mr. President, that I will not register on July 23, or at any time thereafter... . We have tried militarism, and it has failed the human race in every way imaginable

Once he was in office, Ronald Reagan hesitated to renew draft registration, because, as his Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger, explained, ""President Reagan believes that resuming the draft to meet manpower problems would lead to public unrest comparable to that in the sixties and seventies."" William Beecher, a former Pentagon reporter, wrote in November 1981 that Reagan was ""obviously concerned, even alarmed, by the mounting voices of discontent and suspicion over emerging U.S. nuclear strategy both in the streets of Europe and more recently on American campuses.""

Hoping to intimidate this opposition, the Reagan administration began to prosecute draft resisters. One of those facing prison was Benjamin Sasway, who cited U.S. military intervention in El Salvador as a good reason not to register for the draft

Aroused by Sasway's civil disobedience, a right-wing columnist (William A. Rusher, of the National Review) wrote indignantly that one heritage of the sixties was a new generation of antiwar teachers:

Almost certainly there was a teacher, or teachers, who taught Benjamin Sasway to look at American society as a hypocritical, exploitative, materialistic roadblock on the path of human progress. The generation of the Vietnam protesters is now in its early thirties, and the academicians among them are already ensconced in the faculties of the country's high schools and colleges.... What a pity our jurisprudence doesn't allow us to reach and penalize the real architects of this sort of destruction!

Reagan's policy of giving military aid to the dictatorship of El Salvador was not accepted quietly around the nation. He had barely taken office when the following report appeared in the Boston Globe:

It was a scene reminiscent of the 1960s, a rally of students in Harvard Yard shouting antiwar slogans, a candlelight march through the streets of Cambridge.. .. 2000 persons, mostly students, gathered to protest U.S. involvement in El Salvador... . Students from Tufts, MIT, Boston University and Boston College, the University of Massachusetts, Brandeis, Suffolk, Dartmouth, Northeastern, Vassar, Yale and Simmons were represented

During commencement exercises that spring of 1981 at Syracuse University, when Reagan's Secretary of State, Alexander Haig, was given an honorary doctorate in ""public service,"" two hundred students and faculty turned their backs on the presentation. During Haig's address, the press reported, ""Nearly every pause in Mr. Haig's fifteen-minute address was punctuated by chants: 'Human needs, not military greed!' 'Get out of El Salvador!' 'Washington guns killed American nuns!'""
The last slogan was a reference to the execution in the fall of 1980 of four American nuns by Salvadoran soldiers. Thousands of people in El Salvador were being murdered each year by ""death squads"" sponsored by a government armed by the United States, and the American public was beginning to pay attention to events in this tiny Central American country

As has been true generally in the making of U.S. foreign policy, there was no pretense at democracy. Public opinion was simply ignored. A New York Time/CBS News poll in the spring of 1982 reported that only 16 percent of its sampling favored Reagan's program of sending military and economic aid to El Salvador

In the spring of 1983, it was disclosed that an American physician named Charles Clement was working with the Salvadoran rebels. As an Air Force pilot in Southeast Asia, he had become disillusioned with U.S. policy there, having seen firsthand that his government was lying, and refused to fly any more missions. The Air Force response was to commit him to a psychiatric hospital, then to discharge him as psychologically unfit. He went to medical school, and then volunteered to be a doctor with the guerrillas in El Salvador

There was much talk in the American press in the early eighties about the political cautiousness of a new generation of college students concerned mostly with their own careers. But when, at the Harvard commencement of June 1983, Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes criticized American intervention in Latin America, and said, ""Because we are your true friends, we will not permit you to conduct yourselves in Latin American affairs as the Soviet Union conducts itself in Central European and Central Asian affairs,"" he was interrupted twenty times by applause and received a standing ovation when finished

Among my own students at Boston University, I did not find the pervasive selfishness and unconcern with others that the media kept reporting, in deadening repetition, about the students of the eighties. In the journals they kept, I found the following comments:

A male student: ""Do you think anything good that has happened in the world had anything to do with government? I work in Roxbury [a black neighborhood]. I know the government doesn't work. Not for the people of Roxbury, and not for the people anywhere. It works for people with money.""

A graduate of a Catholic high school: ""America to me is a society, a culture. America is my home; if someone were to rob that culture from me, then perhaps there would be reason to resist. I will not die, however, to defend the honor of the government.""

A young woman: ""As a white middle class person I've never felt discriminated against at all. But I'll say this: If anyone ever tried to make me sit in a different schoolroom, use a different bathroom, or anything like that, I would knock them right on their ass.. . . The people are the last ones that need their rights stated on paper, for if they're abused or injusticed by government or authority, they can act on the injustice directly.. . . When you look at the ... statements of rights and laws, it's really government and authority and institutions and corporations that need laws and rights to insulate them from the physicality, the directness of the people.""

Beyond the campuses, out in the country, there was opposition to government policy, not widely known. A report from Tucson, Arizona, early in the Reagan presidency described ""demonstrators, mainly middle-aged,"" protesting at the Federal Building against U.S. involvement in El Salvador. Over a thousand people in Tucson marched in a procession and attended a mass to commemorate the anniversary of the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero, who had spoken out against the Salvadoran death squads

Over 60,000 Americans signed pledges to take action of some sort, including civil disobedience, if Reagan moved to invade Nicaragua. When the President instituted a blockade of the tiny country to try to force its government out of power, there were demonstrations around the country. In Boston alone, 550 people were arrested protesting the blockade

During Reagan's presidency, there were hundreds of actions throughout the nation against his policies in South Africa. He obviously did not want to see the white ruling minority of South Africa displaced by the radical African National Congress, which represented the black majority. Chester Crocker, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, in his memoirs, called Reagan ""insensitive"" to the conditions under which blacks lived there. Public opinion was strong enough to cause Congress to legislate economic sanctions against the South African Government in 1986, overriding Reagan's veto

Reagan's cuts in social services were felt on the local level as vital needs could not he taken care of, and there were angry reactions. In the spring and summer of 1981, residents of East Boston took to the streets; for fifty-five nights they blocked major thoroughfares and the Sumner Tunnel during rush hour, in order to protest cutbacks in funds for fire, police, and teachers. The police superintendent, John Doyle, said: ""Maybe these people are starting to take lessons from the protests of the sixties and seventies."" The Boston Globe reported: ""The demonstrators in East Boston were mostly middle-aged, middle- or working-class people who said they had never protested anything before.""

The Reagan administration took away federal funds for the arts, suggesting that the performing arts seek help from private donors. In New York, two historic Broadway theaters were razed to make way for a luxury fifty-story hotel, after two hundred theater people demonstrated, picketing, reading plays and singing songs, refusing to disperse when ordered by police. Some of the nation's best-known theater personalities were arrested, including producer Joseph Papp, actresses Tammy Grimes, Estelle Parsons, and Celeste Holm, actors Richard Gere and Michael Moriarty

The budget cuts spurred strikes across the country, often by groups unaccustomed to striking. In the fall of 1982, United Press International reported:

Angered by layoffs, salary cuts and uncertainty about job security, more schoolteachers throughout the country have decided to go on strike. Teachers' strikes last week in seven states, from Rhode Island to Washington, have idled more than 300,000 students

Surveying a series of news events in the first week of January 1983, David Nyhan of the Boston Globe wrote: ""There is something brewing in the land that bodes ill for those in Washington who ignore it. People have moved from the frightened state to the angry stage and are acting out their frustrations in ways that will test the fabric of civil order."" He gave some examples:

In Little Washington, Pennsylvania, in early 1983, when a 50-year-old computer science teacher who led a teachers' strike was sent to jail, 2000 people demonstrated outside the jailhouse in his support, and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called it ""the largest crowd in Washington County since the 1794 Whiskey Rebellion.""

When unemployed or bankrupt home owners in the Pittsburgh area could no longer make mortgage payments, and foreclosure sales were scheduled, 60 pickets jammed the courthouse to protest the auction, and Allegheny sheriff Eugene Coon halted the proceedings

The foreclosure of a 320-acre wheat farm in Springfield, Colorado, was interrupted by 200 angry farmers, who had to be dispersed by tear gas and Mace

When Reagan arrived in Pittsburgh in April 1983 to make a speech, 3000 people, many of them unemployed steelworkers, demonstrated against him, standing in the rain outside his hotel. Demonstrations by the unemployed were taking place in Detroit, Flint, Chicago, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Washington—over twenty cities in all

Just around that time, Miami blacks rioted against police brutality; they were reacting against their general deprivation as well. The unemployment rate among young African-Americans had risen above 50 percent, and the Reagan administration's only response to poverty was to build more jails. Understanding that blacks would not vote for him, Reagan tried, unsuccessfully, to get Congress to eliminate a crucial section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which had been very effective in safeguarding the right of blacks to vote in Southern states

Reagan's policies clearly joined the two issues of disarmament and social welfare. It was guns versus children, and this was expressed dramatically by the head of the Children's Defense Fund, Marian Wright Edelman, in a commencement speech at the Milton Academy in Massachusetts in the summer of 1983:

You are graduating into a nation and world teetering on the brink of moral and economic bankruptcy. Since 1980, our President and Congress have been turning our national plowshares into swords and been bringing good news to the rich at the expense of the poor. .. . Children are the major victims. Our misguided national and world choices are literally killing children daily.... Yet governments throughout the world, led by our own, spend over $600 billion a year on arms, while an estimated 1 billion of our world's people live in poverty and 600 million are under- or unemployed. Where is the human commitment and political will to find the relative pittance of money needed to protect children?

She urged her listeners: ""Pick a piece of the problem that you can help solve while trying to see how your piece fits into the broader social change puzzle.""

Her words seemed to represent a growing mood that worried the Reagan administration. It withdrew some of its proposed cutbacks, and Congress eliminated others. When, in its second year, the administration proposed $9 billion in cuts in support for children and poor families, Congress accepted only $1 billion. The Washington correspondent of the New York Time reported: ""Political concerns about the fairness of Mr. Reagan's programs have forced the Administration to curtail its efforts to make further cutbacks in programs for the poor.""

The repeated elections of Republican candidates, Reagan in 1980 and 1984, George Bush in 1988, were treated by the press with words like ""landslide"" and ""overwhelming victory."" They were ignoring four facts: that roughly half the population, though eligible to vote, did not; that those who did vote were limited severely in their choices to the two parties that monopolized the money and the media; that as a result many of their votes were cast without enthusiasm; and that there was little relationship between voting for a candidate and voting for specific policies

In 1980 Reagan received 51.6 percent of the popular vote, while Jimmy Carter received 41.7 percent and John Anderson (a liberal Republican running on a third-party ticket) received 6.7 percent. Only 54 percent of the voting-age population voted, so that—of the total eligible to vote—27 percent voted for Reagan

A survey by the New York Time found that only 11 percent of those who voted for Reagan did so because ""he's a real conservative."" Three times as many said they voted for him because ""it is time for a change.""

For a second term, running against former Vice-President Walter Mondale, Reagan won 59 percent of the popular vote, but with half the electorate not voting, he had 29 percent of the voting population

In the 1988 election, with Vice-President George Bush running against Democrat Michael Dukakis, Bush's 54 percent victory added up to 27 percent of the eligible voters

Because our peculiar voting arrangements allow a small margin of popular votes to become a huge majority of electoral votes, the media can talk about ""overwhelming victory,"" thus deceiving their readers and disheartening those who don't look closely at the statistics. Could one say from these figures that ""the American people"" wanted Reagan, or Bush, as President? One could certainly say that more voters preferred the Republican candidates to their opponents. But even more seemed to want neither candidate. Nevertheless, on the basis of these slim electoral pluralities, Reagan and Bush would claim that ""the people"" had spoken

Indeed, when the people did speak about issues, in surveys of public opinion, they expressed beliefs to which neither the Republican nor Democratic parties paid attention

For instance, both parties, through the eighties and early nineties, kept strict limits on social programs for the poor, on the grounds that this would require more taxes, and ""the people"" did not want higher taxes

This was certainly true as a general proposition, that Americans wanted to pay as little in taxes as possible. But when they were asked if they would be willing to pay higher taxes for specific purposes like health and education, they said yes, they would. For instance, a 1990 poll of Boston area voters showed that 54 percent of them would pay more taxes if that would go toward cleaning up the environment

And when higher taxes were presented in class terms, rather than as a general proposal, people were quite clear. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in December 1990 showed that 84 percent of the respondents favored a surtax on millionaires (this provision was dropped around that time from a Democratic-Republican budget compromise). Even though 51 percent of the respondents were in favor of raising the capital gains tax, neither major party favored that

A Harris/Harvard School of Public Health poll of 1989 showed that most Americans (61 percent) favored a Canadian-type health system, in which the government was the single payer to doctors and hospitals, bypassing the insurance companies, and offering universal medical coverage to everyone. Neither the Democratic nor the Republican party adopted that as its program, although both insisted they wanted to ""reform"" the health system

A survey by the Gordon Black Corporation for the National Press Club in 1992 found that 59 percent of all voters wanted a 50 percent cut in defense spending in five years. Neither of the major parties was willing to make major cuts in the military budget

How the public felt about government aid to the poor seemed to depend on how the question was put. Both parties, and the media, talked incessantly about the ""welfare"" system, that it was not working, and the word ""welfare"" became a signal for opposition. When people were asked (a New York Times/CBS News poll of 1992) if more money should he allocated to welfare, 23 percent said no. But when the same people were asked, should the government help the poor, 64 percent said yes

This was a recurring theme. When, at the height of the Reagan presidency, in 1987, people were asked if the government should guarantee food and shelter to needy people, 62 percent answered yes

Clearly, there was something amiss with a political system, supposed to be democratic, in which the desires of the voters were repeatedly ignored. They could be ignored with impunity so long as the political system was dominated by two parties, both tied to corporate wealth. An electorate forced to choose between Carter and Reagan, or Reagan and Mondale, or Bush and Dukakis could only despair (or decide not to vote) because neither candidate was capable of dealing with a fundamental economic illness whose roots were deeper than any single presidency

That illness came from a fact which was almost never talked about: that the United States was a class society, in which I percent of the population owned 33 percent of the wealth, with an underclass of 30 to 40 million people living in poverty. The social programs of the sixties- Medicare and Medicaid, food stamps, etc.-did not do much more than maintain the historic American maldistribution of resources

While the Democrats would give more help to the poor than the Republicans, they were not capable (indeed, not really desirous) of seriously tampering with an economic system in which corporate profit comes before human need

There was no important national movement for radical change, no social democratic (or democratic socialist) party such as existed in countries in Western Europe, Canada, and New Zealand. But there were a thousand signs of alienation, voices of protest, local actions in every part of the country to call attention to deep-felt grievances, to demand that some injustice be remedied

For instance, the Citizens' Clearinghouse for Hazardous Wastes in Washington, D.C., which had been formed early in the Reagan administration by housewife and activist Lois Gibbs, reported that it was giving help to 8000 local groups around the country. One of these groups, in Oregon, brought a series of successful lawsuits to force the Environmental Protection Agency to do something about unsafe drinking water in the Bull Run reservoir near Portland

In Seabrook, New Hampshire, there were years of persistent protest against a nuclear power plant which residents considered a danger to themselves and their families. Between 1977 and 1989, over 3500 people were arrested in these protests. Ultimately, the plant, plagued by financial problems and opposition, had to shut down

Fear of nuclear accidents was intensified by disastrous events at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979 and by an especially frightening calamity in Chernobyl in the Soviet Union in 1986. All of this was having an effect on the once-booming nuclear industry. By 1994, the Tennessee Valley Authority had stopped the construction of three nuclear plants, which the New York Time called ""the symbolic death notice for the current generation of reactors in the United States.""

In Minneapolis, Minnesota, thousands of people demonstrated year after year against the Honeywell Corporation's military contracts, and between 1982 and 1988 over 1800 people were arrested

Furthermore, when those who engaged in such civil disobedience were brought into court, they often found sympathetic support from juries, winning acquittals from ordinary citizens who seemed to understand that even if they had technically broken the law, they had done so in a good cause

In 1984, a group of Vermont citizens (the ""Winooski Forty-four"") refused to leave the hallway outside a U.S. Senator's office, protesting his votes to give arms to the Nicaraguan contras. They were arrested, but at their trial they were treated sympathetically by the judge and acquitted by the jury

At another trial shortly after, a number of people (including activist Abbie Hoffman and Amy Carter, daughter of former President Jimmy Carter) were charged with blocking CIA recruiters at the University of Massachusetts. They called to the witness stand ex-CIA agents who told the jury that the CIA had engaged in illegal and murderous activities all around the world. The jury acquitted them

One juror, a woman hospital worker, said later: ""I was not familiar with the CIA's activities.... I was shocked.... I was kind of proud of the students."" Another juror said: ""It was very educational."" The county district attorney, prosecuting the case, concluded: ""If there is a message, it was that this jury was composed of middle America.. .. Middle America doesn't want the CIA doing what they are doing.""

In the South, while there was no great movement comparable to the civil rights movement of the Sixties, there were hundreds of local groups organizing poor people, white and black. In North Carolina, Linda Stout, the daughter of a mill worker who had died of industrial poisons, coordinated a multiracial network of 500 textile workers, farmers, maids—most of them low-income women of color—in the Piedmont Peace Project

The historic Highlander Folk School in Tennessee, which had nurtured so many black and white activists throughout the South, was now joined by other folk schools and popular education centers

Anne Braden, a veteran of racial and labor struggles in the South, was still organizing, leading the Southern Organizing Committee for Economic and Social Justice. The group gave help in local actions: to 300 African-Americans in Tift County, Georgia, who were protesting the existence of a chemical plant which was making them sick; to Native Americans in Cherokee County, North Carolina, who were organizing to stop a polluted landfill

Back in the sixties, Chicane farm workers, people of Mexican descent who came to work and live mostly in California and the Southwestern states, rebelled against their feudal working conditions. They went out on strike and organized a national boycott of grapes, under the leadership of Cesar Chavez. Soon farmworkers were organizing in other parts of the country

In the seventies and eighties, their struggles against poverty and discrimination continued. The Reagan years hit them hard, as it did poor people all over the country. By 1984, 42 percent of all Latino children and one-fourth of the families lived below the poverty line

Copper miners in Arizona, mostly Mexican, went on strike against the Phelps-Dodge company after it cut wages, benefits, and safety measures in 1983. They were attacked by National Guardsmen and state troopers, by tear gas and helicopters, but held out for three years until a combination of governmental and corporate power finally defeated them

There were victories too. In 1985, 1700 cannery workers, most of them Mexican women, went on strike in Watsonville, California, and won a union contract with medical benefits. In 1990 workers who had been laid off from the Levi Strauss company in San Antonio because the company was moving to Costa Rica called a boycott, organized a hunger strike, and won concessions. In Los Angeles, Latino janitors went on strike in 1990 and despite police attacks, won recognition of their union, a pay raise, and sick benefits

Latino and Latina activists (not necessarily Chicano, which refers to those of Mexican ancestry), through the eighties and early nineties, campaigned for better labor conditions, for representation in local government, for tenants' rights, for bilingual education in the schools. Kept out of the media, they organized a bilingual radio movement, and by 1991 had fourteen Latino stations in the country, twelve of them bilingual

In New Mexico, Latinos fought for land and water rights against real estate developers who tried to throw them off land they had lived on for decades. In 1988 there was a confrontation, and the people organized an armed occupation, built bunkers for protection against attack, and won support from other communities in the Southwest; finally, a court ruled in their favor

Abnormal rates of cancer for farmworkers in California aroused the Chicano community. Cesar Chavez of the United Farm Workers fasted for thirty-five days in 1988 to call attention to these conditions. There were now United Farm Workers unions in Texas, Arizona, and other states

The importation of Mexican workers for low wages, under terrible conditions, spread from the Southwest to other parts of the country. By 1991, 80,000 Latinos lived in North Carolina, 30,000 in north Georgia. The Farm Labor Organizing Committee, which had won a difficult strike in the Ohio tomato fields in 1979, the largest agricultural strike ever in the Midwest, brought thousands of farmworkers together in several Midwest states

As the Latino population of the country kept growing, it soon matched the 12 percent of the population that was African-American and began to have a distinct effect on American culture. Much of its music, art, and drama was much more consciously political and satirical than mainstream culture

The Border Arts workshop was formed in 1984 by artists and writers in San Diego and Tijuana, and its work dealt powerfully with issues of racism and injustice. In Northern California, Teatro Campesino and Teatro de la Esperanza performed for working people all over the country, turning schoolhouses, churches, and fields into theaters

Latinos were especially conscious of the imperial role the United States had played in Mexico and the Caribbean, and many of them became militant critics of U.S. policy toward Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Cuba. In 1970 a great march in Los Angeles against the Vietnam war, which had been attacked by police, left three Chicanos dead

When the Bush administration was preparing for war against Iraq in the summer of 1990, thousands of people in Los Angeles marched along the same route they had taken twenty years before, when they were protesting the Vietnam war. As Elizabeth Martinez wrote (500 Years of Chicano History in Pictures):

Before and during President Bush's war in the Persian Gulf many people- including Raza [literally ""race""; a term adopted by Latino activists]-had doubts about it or were opposed. We had learned some lessons about wars started in the name of democracy that turned out to benefit only the rich and powerful. Raza mobilized to protest this war of mass murder, even faster than the U.S. war in Vietnam, though we could not stop it

In 1992, a fund-raising group which came out of the Vietnam war called Resist made donations to 168 organizations around the country- community groups, peace groups, Native American groups, prisoners' rights organizations, health and environmental groups

A new generation of lawyers, schooled in the sixties, constituted a small but socially conscious minority within the legal profession. They were in court defending the poor and the helpless, or bringing suit against powerful corporations. One law firm used its talent and energy to defend whistleblowers—men and women who were fired because they ""blew the whistle"" on corporate corruption that victimized the public

The women's movement, which had managed to raise the consciousness of the whole nation on the issue of sexual equality, faced a powerful backlash in the eighties. The Supreme Court's defense of abortion rights in its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision aroused a pro-life movement that had strong supporters in Washington. Congress passed, and the Supreme Court later let stand, a law that eliminated federal medical benefits to help poor women pay for abortions. But the National Organization of Women and other groups remained strong; in 1989, a Washington rally for what had come to be known as the right to choose drew over 300,000 people. When, in 1994 and 1995, abortion clinics were attacked and several supporters murdered, the conflict became grimly intense

The rights of gay and lesbian Americans had come vividly to the forefront in the Seventies with radical changes in ideas about sexuality and freedom. The gay movement then became a visible presence in the nation, with parades, demonstrations, campaigns for the elimination of state statutes discriminating against homosexuals. One result was a growing literature about the hidden history of gay life in the United States and in Europe

In 1994, there was a Stonewall 25 march in Manhattan, which commemorated an event homosexuals regarded as a turning point: twenty-five years earlier, gay men fought back vigorously against a police raid on the Stonewall bar in Greenwich Village. In the early nineties, gay and lesbian groups campaigned more openly, more determinedly, against discrimination, and for more attention to the scourge of AIDS, which they claimed was being given only marginal attention by the national government

In Rochester, New York, a local campaign achieved an unprecedented decision barring military recruiters from a school district because of the Defense Department discrimination against gay soldiers

The labor movement in the eighties and nineties was considerably weakened by the decline of manufacturing, by the flight of factories to other countries, by the hostility of the Reagan administration and its appointees on the National Labor Relations Board. Yet organizing continued, especially among white collar workers and low-income people of color. The AFL-CIO put on hundreds of new organizers to work among Latinos, African-Americans, and Asian-Americans

Rank-and-file workers in old, stagnant unions began to rebel. In 1991, the notoriously corrupt leadership of the powerful Teamsters Union was voted out of office by a reform slate. The new leadership immediately became a force in Washington, and took the lead in working for independent political coalitions outside the two major parties. But the labor movement as a whole, much diminished, was struggling for survival

Against the overwhelming power of corporate wealth and governmental authority, the spirit of resistance was kept alive in the early nineties, often by small-scale acts of courage and defiance. On the West Coast, a young activist named Keith McHenry and hundreds of others were arrested again and again for distributing free food to poor people without a license. They were part of a program called Food Not Bombs. More Food Not Bombs groups sprang up in communities around the country

In 1992, a New York group interested in revising traditional ideas about American history received approval from the New York City Council to put up thirty metal plaques high on lampposts around the city. One of them, placed opposite the Morgan corporate headquarters, identified the famous banker J.P. Morgan as a Civil War ""draft dodger."" In fact, Morgan had avoided the draft and profited in business deals with the government during the war. Another plaque, placed near the Stock Exchange, portrayed a suicide and carried the label ""Advantage of an Unregulated Free Market.""

The general disillusionment with government during the Vietnam years and the Watergate scandals, the exposure of anti-democratic actions by the FBI and the CIA, led to resignations from government and open criticism by former employees

A number of former CIA officials left the agency, and wrote books critical of its activities. John Stockwell, who had headed the CIA operation in Angola, resigned, wrote a hook exposing the CIA's activities, and lectured all over the country about his experiences. David MacMichael, a historian and former CIA specialist, testified at trials on behalf of people who had protested government policy in Central America

FBI Agent Jack Ryan, a twenty-one-year veteran of the bureau, was fired when he refused to investigate peace groups. He was deprived of his pension and for some time had to live in a shelter for homeless people

Sometimes the war in Vietnam, which had ended in 1975, came back to public attention in the eighties and nineties through people who had been involved in the conflicts of that day. Some of them had since made dramatic turnabouts in their thinking. John Wall, who prosecuted Dr. Benjamin Spock and four others in Boston for ""conspiring"" to obstruct the draft, showed up at a dinner honoring the defendants in 1994, saying the trial had changed his ideas

Even more striking was the statement by Charles Hutto, a U.S. soldier who had participated in the atrocity known as the My Lai massacre, in which a company of American soldiers shot to death women and children by the hundreds in a tiny Vietnamese village. Interviewed in the eighties, Hutto told a reporter:

I was nineteen years old, and I'd always been told to do what the grown-ups told me to do. , . . But now I'll tell my sons, if the government calls, to go, to serve their country, but to use their own judgment at times ... to forget about authority ... to use their own conscience. I wish somebody had told me that before I went to Vietnam. I didn't know. Now I don't think there should be even a thing called war ... cause it messes up a person's mind

It was this legacy of the Vietnam war-the feeling among a great majority of Americans that it was a terrible tragedy, a war that should not have been fought-that plagued the Reagan and Bush administrations, which still hoped to extend American power around the world

In 1985, when George Bush was Vice-President, former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger had warned the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: ""Vietnam brought a sea change in domestic attitudes ... a breakdown in the political consensus behind foreign policy. . ..""

When Bush became President, he was determined to overcome what came to be called the Vietnam syndrome-the resistance of the American people to a war desired by the Establishment. And so, he launched the air war against Iraq in mid-January 1991 with overwhelming force, so the war could be over quickly, before there was time for a national antiwar movement to develop

The signs of a possible movement were there in the months of the prewar buildup. On Halloween, 600 students marched through downtown Missoula, Montana, shouting ""Hell no, we won't go!"" In Shreveport, Louisiana, despite the Shreveport Journal's front-page headline: ""Poll Favors Military Action,"" the story was that 42 percent of the respondents thought the U.S. should ""initiate force"" and 41 percent said ""wait and see.""

The November 11, 1990, Veterans Parade in Boston was joined by a group called Veterans for Peace, carrying signs: ""No More Vietnams. Bring 'Em Home Now"" and ""Oil and Blood Do Not Mix, Wage Peace."" The Boston Globe reported that ""the protesters were greeted with respectful applause and, at some places, strong demonstrations of support by onlookers."" One of those onlookers, a woman named Mary Belle Dressier, said: ""Personally, parades that honor the military are somewhat troublesome to me because the military is about war, and war is troublesome to me.""

Most Vietnam veterans were supporting military action, but there was a strong dissident minority. In one survey that showed 53 percent of the veterans polled saying they would gladly serve in the Gulf War, 37 percent said they would not

Perhaps the most famous Vietnam veteran, Ron Kovic, author of Born on the Fourth of July, made a thirty-second television speech as Bush moved toward war. In the appeal, broadcast on 200 television stations in 120 cities across the country, he asked all citizens to ""stand up and speak out"" against war. ""How many more Americans coming home in wheelchairs—like me—will it take before we learn?""

That November of 1990, several months into the Kuwait crisis, college students in St. Paul, Minnesota, demonstrated against war. The local press reported:

It was a full-blown antiwar demonstration with mothers pushing kids in strollers, college professors and grade school teachers carrying signs, peace activists bedecked in peace symbols, and hundreds of students from a dozen schools singing, beating drums and chanting, ""Hey, hey, ho ho, we won't fight for Amoco.""

Ten days before the bombing began, at a town meeting in Boulder, Colorado, with 800 people present, the question was put: ""Do you support Bush's policy for war?"" Only four people raised their hands. A few days before the war began, 4100 people in Santa Fe, New Mexico, blocked a four-lane highway for an hour, asking that there be no war. Residents said this was larger than any demonstration in the Vietnam era

On the eve of war, 6000 people marched through Ann Arbor, Michigan, to ask for peace. On the night the war began, 5000 people gathered in San Francisco to denounce the war and formed a human chain around the Federal Building. Police broke the chain by swinging their clubs at the hands of the protesters. But the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution declaring the city and county a sanctuary for those who for ""moral, ethical or religious reasons cannot participate in war.""

The night before Bush gave the order to launch the bombing, a seven-year-old girl in Lexington, Massachusetts, told her mother she wanted to write a letter to the President. Her mother suggested it was late and she should write the next day. ""No, tonight,"" the girl said. She was still learning to write, so she dictated a letter:

Dear President Bush. I don't like the way you are behaving. If you would make up your mind there won't be a war we won't have to have peace vigils. If you were in a war you wouldn't want to get hurt. What I'm saying is: I don't want any fighting to happen. Sincerely yours, Serena Kabat

After the bombing of Iraq began along with the bombardment of public opinion, the polls showed overwhelming support for Bush's action, and this continued through the six weeks of the war. But was it an accurate reflection of the citizenry's long-term feelings about war? The split vote in the polls just before the war reflected a public still thinking its opinion might have an effect. Once the war was on, and clearly irreversible, in an atmosphere charged with patriotic fervor (the president of the United Church of Christ spoke of ""the steady drumbeat of war messages""), it was not surprising that a great majority of the country would declare its support

Nevertheless, even with little time to organize, and with the war over very fast, there was an opposition-a minority for sure, but a determined one, and with the potential to grow. Compared to the first months of the military escalation in Vietnam, the movement against the Gulf War expanded with extraordinary speed and vigor

That first week of the war, while it was clear most Americans were supporting Bush's action, tens of thousands of people took to the streets in protest, in towns and cities all over the country. In Athens, Ohio, over 100 people were arrested, as they clashed with a prowar group. In Portland, Maine, 500 marched wearing white arm bands or carrying white paper crosses with one word, ""Why?,"" written in red

At the University of Georgia, 70 students opposed to the war held an all-night vigil, and in the Georgia Legislature, Representative Cynthia McKinnon made a speech attacking the bombing of Iraq, leading many of the other legislators to walk off the floor. She held her ground, and it seemed that there had been at least some change In thinking since Representative Julian Bond was expelled from the very same legislature for criticizing the war in Vietnam during the 1960s. At a junior high school in Newton, Massachusetts, 350 students marched to city hall to present a petition to the mayor declaring their opposition to the war in the Gulf. Clearly, many were trying to reconcile their feelings about war with their sympathy for soldiers sent to the Middle East. A student leader, Carly Baker, said: ""We don't think bloodshed is the right way. We are supporting the troops and are proud of them, but we don't want war.""

In Ada, Oklahoma, while East Central Oklahoma State University was ""adopting"" two National Guard units, two young women sat quietly on top of the concrete entrance gate with signs that read ""Teach Peace ... Not War."" One of them, Patricia Biggs, said: ""I don't think we should be over there. I don't think it's about justice and liberty, I think it's about economics. The big oil corporations have a lot to do with what is going on over there. . . . We are risking people's lives for money.""

Four days after the United States launched its air attack, 75,000 people (the estimate of the Capitol Police) marched in Washington, rallying near the White House to denounce the war. In Southern California, Ron Kovic addressed 6000 people who chanted ""Peace Now!"" In Fayetteville, Arkansas, a group supporting military policy was confronted by the Northwest Arkansas Citizens Against War, who marched carrying a flag-draped coffin and a banner that read ""Bring Them Home Alive.""

Another disabled Vietnam veteran, a professor of history and political science at York College in Pennsylvania named Philip Avillo, wrote in a local newspaper: ""Yes, we need to support our men and women under arms. But let's support them by bringing them home; not by condoning this barbarous, violent policy."" In Salt Lake City, hundreds of demonstrators, many with children, marched through the city's main streets chanting antiwar slogans

In Vermont, which had just elected Socialist Bernie Sanders to Congress, over 2000 demonstrators disrupted a speech by the governor at the state house, and in Burlington, Vermont's largest city, 300 protesters walked through the downtown area, asking shop owners to close their doors in solidarity

On January 26, nine days after the beginning of the war, over 150,000 people marched through the streets of Washington, D.C., and listened to speakers denounce the war, including the movie stars Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins. A woman from Oakland, California, held up the folded American flag that was given to her when her husband was killed in Vietnam, saying, ""I learned the hard way there is no glory in a folded flag.""

Labor unions had supported the war in Vietnam for the most part, but after the bombing started in the Gulf, eleven affiliates of the AFL-CIO, including some of its more powerful unions—like steel, auto, communications, chemical workers—spoke out against the war

The black community was far less enthusiastic than the rest of the country about what the U.S. Air Force was doing to Iraq. An ABC News/Washington Post poll in early February, 1991, found that support for the war was 84 percent among whites, but only 48 percent among African-Americans

When the war had been going on for a month, with Iraq devastated by the incessant bombing, there were feelers from Saddam Hussein that Iraq would withdraw from Kuwait if the United States would stop its attacks. Bush rejected the idea, and a meeting of black leaders in New York sharply criticized him, calling the war ""an immoral and unspiritual diversion ... a blatant evasion of our domestic responsibilities.""

In Selma, Alabama, which had been the scene of bloody police violence against civil rights marchers twenty-six years before, a meeting to observe the anniversary of that ""bloody Sunday"" demanded that ""our troops be brought home alive to fight for justice at home.""

The father of a twenty-one-year-old Marine in the Persian Gulf, Alex Molnar, wrote an angry open letter, published in the New York Time, to President Bush:

Where were you, Mr. President, when Iraq was killing its own people with poison gas? Why, until the recent crisis, was it business as usual with Saddam Hussein, the man you now call a Hitler? Is the American ""way of life"" that you say my son is risking his life for the continued ""right"" of Americans to consume 25 to 30 percent of the world's oil? ... I intend to support my son and his fellow soldiers by doing everything I can to oppose any offensive American military action in the Persian Gulf

There were courageous individual acts by citizens, speaking out in spite of threats

Peg Mullen, of Brownsville, Texas, whose son had been killed by ""friendly fire"" in Vietnam, organized a busload of mothers to protest in Washington, in spite of a warning that her house would be burned down if she persisted

The actress Margot Kidder (""Lois Lane"" in the Superman films), despite the risk to her career, spoke out eloquently against the war

A basketball player for Seton Hall University in New Jersey refused to wear the American flag on his uniform, and when he became the object of derision for this, he left the team and the university, and returned to his native Italy

More tragically, a Vietnam veteran in Los Angeles set fire to himself and died, to protest the war

In Amherst, Massachusetts, a young man carrying a cardboard peace sign knelt on the town common, poured two cans of flammable fluid on himself, struck two matches, and died in the flames. Two hours later, students from nearby universities gathered on the common for a candlelight vigil, and placed peace signs at the site of death. One of the signs read, ""Stop this crazy war.""

There was no time, as there had been during the Vietnam conflict, for a large antiwar movement to develop in the military. But there were men and women who defied their commanders and refused to participate in the war

When the first contingents of U.S. troops were being sent to Saudi Arabia, in August of 1990, Corporal Jeff Patterson, a twenty-two-year-old Marine stationed in Hawaii, sat down on the runway of the airfield and refused to board a plane bound for Saudi Arabia. He asked to be discharged from the Marine Corps:

I have come to believe that there are no justified wars.... I began to question exactly what I was doing in the Marine Corps about the time I began to read about history. I began to read up on America's support for the murderous regimes of Guatemala, Iran under the Shah, and El Salvador.... I object to the military use of force against any people, anywhere, any time

Fourteen Marine Corps reservists at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, filed for conscientious objector status, despite the prospect of a court-martial for desertion. A lance corporal in the Marines, Erik Larsen, issued a statement:

I declare myself a conscientious objector. Here is my sea bag full of personal gear. Here is my gas mask. I no longer need them. I am no longer a Marine. ... It, to me, is embarrassing to fight for a way of life in which basic human needs, like a place to sleep, one hot meal a day and some medical attention, cannot even be met in our nation's capital

Corporal Yolanda Huet-Vaughn, a physician who was a captain in the Army Reserve Medical Corps, a mother of three young children, and a member of the Physicians for Social Responsibility, was called to active duty in December 1990, a month before the start of the war. She replied: ""I am refusing orders to be an accomplice in what I consider an immoral, inhumane and unconstitutional act, namely an offensive military mobilization in the Middle East."" She was court-martialed, convicted of desertion, and sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison

Another soldier, Stephanie Atkinson of Murphysboro, Illinois, refused to report for active duty, saying she thought the U.S. military was in the Persian Gulf solely for economic reasons. She was first placed under house arrest, then given a discharge under ""other than honorable conditions.""

An Army physician named Harlow Ballard, stationed at Fort Devens in Massachusetts, refused to follow an order to go to Saudi Arabia. ""I would rather go to jail than support this war,"" he said. ""I don't believe there is any such thing as a just war.""

Over a thousand reservists declared themselves conscientious objectors. A twenty-three-year-old Marine Corps reservist named Rob Calabro was one of them. ""My father tells me that he's ashamed of me, he screams at me that he's embarrassed by me. But I believe that killing people is morally wrong. I believe I'm serving my country more by being true to my conscience than by living a lie.""

An information network sprang up during the Gulf War to tell what was not being told in the major media. There were alternative newspapers in many cities. There were over a hundred community radio stations, able to reach only a fraction of those tuned in to the major networks but the only sources, during the Gulf War, of critical analyses of the war. An ingenious radio person in Boulder, Colorado, named David Barsamian recorded a speech by Noam Chomsky made at Harvard-a devastating critique of the war. He then sent the cassette out to his network of community stations, which were eager for a point of view different from the official one. Two young men in New Jersey then transcribed the talk, put it in pamphlet form, in a shape easily photocopied, and placed the pamphlets in bookstores all over the country

After ""victorious"" wars there is almost always a sobering effect, as the war fervor wears off, and citizens assess the costs and wonder what was gained. War fever was at its height in February 1991. In that month, when people being polled were reminded of the huge costs of the war, only 17 percent said the war was not worth it. Four months later, in June, the figure was 30 percent. In the months that followed, Bush's support in the nation dropped steeply, as economic conditions deteriorated. (And in 1992, with the war spirit evaporated, Bush went down to defeat.)

After the disintegration of the Soviet bloc began in 1989, there had been talk in the United States of a ""peace dividend,"" the opportunity to take billions of dollars from the military budget and use it for human needs. The war in the Gulf became a convenient excuse for the government determined to stop such talk. A member of the Bush administration said: ""We owe Saddam a favor. He saved us from the peace dividend"" (New York Time, March 2, 1991)

But the idea of a peace dividend could not be stifled so long as Americans were in need. Shortly after the war, historian Marilyn Young warned:

The U.S. can destroy Iraq's highways, but not build its own; create the conditions for epidemic in Iraq, but not offer health care to millions of Americans. It can excoriate Iraqi treatment of the Kurdish minority, but not deal with domestic race relations; create homelessness abroad but not solve it here; keep a half million troops drug free as part of a war, but refuse to fund the treatment of millions of drug addicts at home. ... We shall lose the war after we have won it

In 1992, the limits of military victory became apparent during the quincentennial celebrations of Columbus's arrival in the Western Hemisphere. Five hundred years ago Columbus and his fellow conquerors had wiped out the native population of Hispaniola. This was followed during the next four centuries by the methodical destruction of Indian tribes by the United States government as it marched across the continent. But now, there was a dramatic reaction

The Indians—the Native Americans—had become a visible force since the sixties and seventies, and in 1992 were joined by other Americans to denounce the quincentennial celebrations. For the first time in all the years that the country had celebrated Columbus Day, there were nationwide protests against honoring a man who had kidnapped, enslaved, mutilated, murdered the natives who greeted his arrival with gifts and friendship

Preparations for the quincentennial began on both sides of the controversy. Official commissions, nationally and in the states, were set up long before the year of the quincentennial

This spurred action by Native Americans. In the summer of 1990 350 Indians, representatives from all over the hemisphere, met in Quito, Ecuador, at the first intercontinental gathering of indigenous people in the Americas, to mobilize against the glorification of the Columbus conquest

The following summer, in Davis, California, over a hundred Native Americans gathered for a follow-up meeting to the Quito conference. They declared October 12, 1992, International Day of Solidarity with Indigenous People, and resolved to inform the king of Spain that the replicas of Columbus's three ships, the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria, ""will not receive permission from the Native Nations to land in the western hemisphere unless he apologizes for the original incursion 500 years ago. . ..""

The movement grew. The largest ecumenical body in the United States, the National Council of Churches, called on Christians to refrain from celebrating the Columbus quincentennial, saying, ""What represented newness of freedom, hope and opportunity for some was the occasion for oppression, degradation and genocide for others.""

The National Endowment for the Humanities funded a traveling exhibition called ""First Encounter,"" which romanticized the Columbus conquest. When the exhibition opened at the Florida Museum of National History, Michelle Diamond, a freshman at the University of Florida, climbed aboard a replica of one of Columbus's ships with a sign reading ""Exhibit Teaches Racism."" She said: ""It's a human issue—not just a Red [Indian] issue."" She was arrested and charged with trespassing, but demonstrations continued for sixteen days against the exhibit

A newspaper called Indigenous Thought began publication in early 1991 to create a link among all the counter-Columbus quincentenary activities. It carried articles by Native Americans about current struggles over land stolen by treaty

In Corpus Christi, Texas, Indians and Chicanos joined to protest the city's celebrations of the quincentennial. A woman named Angelina Mendez spoke for the Chicanos: ""The Chicano nation, in solidarity with our Indian brothers and sisters to the north, come together with them on this day to denounce the atrocity the U.S. government proposes in reenacting the arrival of the Spanish, more specifically the arrival of Cristobal Colon, to the shores of this land.""

The Columbus controversy brought an extraordinary burst of educational and cultural activity. A professor at the University of California at San Diego, Deborah Small, put together an exhibit of over 200 paintings on wood panels called ""1492."" She juxtaposed words from Columbus's diary with blown-up fragments from sixteenth-century engravings to dramatize the horrors that accompanied Columbus's arrival in the hemisphere. A reviewer wrote that ""it does remind us, in the most vivid way, of how the coming of Western-style civilization to the New World doesn't provide us with a sunny tale.""

When President Bush attacked Iraq in 1991, claiming that he was acting to end the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, a group of Native Americans in Oregon distributed a biting and ironic ""open letter"":

Dear President Bush. Please send your assistance in freeing our small nation from occupation. This foreign force occupied our lands to steal our rich resources. They used biological warfare and deceit, killing thousands of elders, children and women in the process. As they overwhelmed our land, they deposed our leaders and people of our own government, and in its place, they installed their own government systems that yet today control our daily lives in many ways. As in your own words, the occupation and overthrow of one small nation ... is one too many. Sincerely, An American Indian

The publication Rethinking Schools, which represented socially conscious schoolteachers all over the country, printed a 100-page book called Rethinking Columbus, featuring articles by Native Americans and others, a critical review of children's books on Columbus, a listing of resources for people wanting more information on Columbus, and more reading material on counter- quincentenary activities. In a few months, 200,000 copies of the book were sold

A Portland, Oregon, teacher named Bill Bigelow, who helped put together Rethinking Schools, took a year off from his regular job to tour the country in 1992, giving workshops to other teachers, so that they could begin to tell those truths about the Columbus experience that were omitted from the traditional books and class curricula

One of Bigelow's own students wrote to the publisher Allyn and Bacon with a critique of their history text The American Spirit:

I'll just pick one topic to keep it simple. How about Columbus. No, you didn't lie, but saying, ""Though they had a keen interest in the peoples of the Caribbean, Columbus and his crews were never able to live peacefully among them,"" makes it seem as if Columbus did no wrong. The reason for not being able to live peacefully is that he and crew took slaves and killed thousands of Indians for not bringing enough gold

Another student wrote: ""It seemed to me as if the publishers had just printed up some 'glory story' that was supposed to make us feel more patriotic about our country. . .. They want us to look at our country as great and powerful and forever right. . . .""

A student named Rebecca wrote: ""Of course, the writers of the books probably think it's harmless enough-what does it matter who discovered America, really.... But the thought that I have been lied to all my life about this, and who knows what else, really makes me angry.""

A group was formed on the West Coast called Italian-Americans Against Christopher Columbus, saying: ""When Italian-Americans identify with Native people ... we are bringing ourselves, each of us, closer to possible change in the world.""

In Los Angeles, a high school student named Blake Lindsey went before the city council to argue against celebrating the quincentennial. She spoke to the council about the genocide of the Arawaks, but she got no official response. However, when she told her story on a talk show, a woman phoned in who said she was from Haiti: ""The girl is right. We have no Indians left. At our last uprising in Haiti people destroyed the statue of Columbus. Let's have statues for the aborigines.""

There were counter-Columbus activities all over the country, unmentioned in the press or on television. In Minnesota alone, a listing of such activities for 1992 reported dozens of workshops, meetings, films, art shows. At Lincoln Center in New York City, on October 12, there was a performance of Leonard Lehrmann's New World: An Opera About What Columbus Did to the Indians. In Baltimore, there was a multimedia show about Columbus. In Boston and then in a national tour, the Underground Railway Theater performed The Christopher Columbus Follies to packed audiences

The protests, the dozens of new books that were appearing about Indian history, the discussions taking place all over the country, were bringing about an extraordinary transformation in the educational world. For generations, exactly the same story had been told all American schoolchildren about Columbus, a romantic, admiring story. Now, thousands of teachers around the country were beginning to tell that story differently

This aroused anger among defenders of the old history, who derided what they called a movement for ""political correctness"" and ""multicultural-ism."" They resented the critical treatment of Western expansion and imperialism, which they considered an attack on Western civilization. Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Education, William Bennett, had called Western civilization ""our common culture ... its highest ideas and aspirations.""

A much-publicized book by a philosopher named Allan Bloom, The Closing of the American Mind, expressed horror at what the social movements of the sixties had done to change the educational atmosphere of American universities. To him Western civilization was the high point of human progress, and the United States its best representative: ""America tells one story: the unbroken, ineluctable progress of freedom and equality. From its first settlers and its political foundings on, there has been no dispute that freedom and equality are the essence of justice for us.""

In the seventies and eighties, disabled people organized and created a movement powerful enough to bring about the passage by Congress of the Americans with Disabilities Act. It was an unprecedented piece of legislation, setting standards which would enable persons with disabilities to contest discrimination against them, and ensuring they would have access to places where their disabilities would otherwise bar them

In the civil rights movement, black people disputed that claim of America's standing for ""freedom and equality."" The women's movement had disputed that claim, too. And now, in 1992, Native Americans were pointing to the crimes of Western civilization against their ancestors. They were recalling the communitarian spirit of the Indians Columbus met and conquered, trying to tell the history of those millions of people who were here before Columbus, giving the lie to what a Harvard historian (Perry Miller) had called ""the movement of European culture into the vacant wilderness of America.""

As the United States entered the nineties, the political system, whether Democrats or Republicans were in power, remained in the control of those who had great wealth. The main instruments of information were also dominated by corporate wealth. The country was divided, though no mainstream political leader would speak of it, into classes of extreme wealth and extreme poverty, separated by an insecure and jeopardized middle class

Yet, there was, unquestionably, though largely unreported, what a worried mainstream journalist had called ""a permanent adversarial culture"" which refused to surrender the possibility of a more equal, more humane society. If there was hope for the future of America, it lay in the promise of that refusalEmbed"

And give it to you motherfuckers like Busta-Bust

There's a for sale sign on a big old rusty tractor
You can't miss it, It's the first thing that you see
Just up the road, a pale blue water tower
With ""I Love Jenny"" painted in bright green
Hey that's my Uncle Bill there by the courthouse
He'll be lowering the flag when the sun goes down

Where I was raised
Where I keep all my yesterdays
Where I ran off cause I got mad
And it came to blows with my old man
Well I came back and settled down
It's where they'll put me in the ground
Yeah this is My town
(Nana na na na)
Yeah this is My town

[Verse 2]
There ain't much going on here since they closed the mill
That whistle still blows every day at noon
A bunch of us still go down to the diner
I wonder if that Interstate's still coming through
But come Sunday morning service at the Church of Christ
Well there ain't an empty seat to be found

You can hump them, lift them, bend them
Give them something to remember
Yell out ""Timber!"" when you fall through the chop shop

A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same
But all the miles that separate
Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, it's only you and me, yeah

The miles just keep rolling
As the people leave their way to say hello
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go
Oh yeah, yeah

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby

When it's all said and done

You know, I was talkin' to this girl
She was talkin' about the music all fast in the club, you know
She gotta drink water 'cause she thirsty
She done danced like ninety to a hundred songs back to back
When ain't nobody, you know, really try to find out what she feelin'

(Are you gonna be?) Check it out, this is what she said

And when I come over and bend ya ass

Silly of me to dream of one day havin' your kids

I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that

Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
Show they toes, you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police, picture that
Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't faze me
When he drop, take his Glock and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

But still I'm havin' memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushin' the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested, and flipped
He screamed ""Thug Life!"" and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin' from the police

Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

And I don't really care if it's platinum or white gold
As long as the VS bling, look at that light show
In the hood they say 50 man your sneaker look right yo
Just can't believe Reebok did a deal with a psycho

Different color coupes but I'm in love with the black one
On point, cause you get R.I.P.'s when slacking
So the stash box big enough to squeeze the MAC in
Yeah, I'm fairly new but I demand some respect
Cause I already wear your advance on my neck
I'm fresh off the jet, then I breeze to the beaches
Blue Yankee fitted, G-Unit sneakers
I already figured out what to do with all my features
Decorate the basement, full of street sweepers
When it comes to stunting there's nothing you can teach us
We're in a different time zone, your records don't reach us

My Sprewell's spinning man, I'm doing my thing
And whodi now in trouble now that you in the game
Come on now, we all know gold is getting old
The ice in my teeth keep the Cristal cold

But we ain't coming down, it be them same ol' clowns
Aiming your pound, pretending they proud
But when you leave town they go around they running they mouth (maaann)
They something like a hater, man
Talking bad about a playa as if I'm not gon' see ya later, man
You constantly frontin' until you confronted on
If you don't like whats going on goin' to another song
'Cause I keep a hater guilty
My cars and my money all alike man, both them filthy (get it?)
From skimpy and empty to fuel on full
See I be high when my 'Ca-go Bulls
Obey no rules to school you fools
Schoolboy's err'y where, we're Young Dude news (maann)

And the Young Dude done paid young dudes' dues dude

And I will never have to borrow
Got my first car when I turned sixteen
Only drove it home outta town limousines
Plus we was broke wit a deal but nobody could tell
So we did what we had to do for ""Country Grammar"" to sell
Haha, I stay on my own melodies
Plus I like my booties and my boobs like a capital letter 'B'
That's how it is, how it better be
I preferably rather have two or three girls in the bed wit' me
Close your ears, ma, you ain't heard nothing (what?)
I always pay ma, let a brother hold something
I'm basically coming from nothing to something
When I say nothing meaning pocket full of lint and buttons

And we all push it, but me I push it real good
Brains blown out, chromed out, wheel real wood
Catch me on your local derrty
Or in the studio doing vocals derrty

And I'll come up wit' these verses that I'm usually slanging

For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp

Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man

For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had, um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin
I said, ""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?""
""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!""

And time stood still and love was all we knew
You were the first, so was I
We made love and then you cried

Remember when we vowed the vows
And walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, there was hurt
Remember when

Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts

Remember when the sound of little feet
Was the music
We danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up

Remember when thirty seemed so old
Now lookn' back it's just a steppin' stone
To where we are
Where we've been

When the children grow up and move away

- Hm.

- Manny.
- Hm.

- Manny.
- Ah-ah.

What time is it? Can we close up yet?
Hey, you're still open. It's Friday night.

Friday night? We should have
been closed hours ago.

Time to get out of these work clothes.

Look, Bernard, look at my new phone.

It's got web access, it's got a camera,
it can do everything.

- Can it stop boring conversations?
- No, none of them can do that.

Mine can. Shut up about your phone.

I think tonight's
gonna be something special.

- We should open our best bottle.
- Not the ?4.49!

Tonight's the night. This is
the stuff Napoleon would have drunk
if he'd been a bit strapped
and he couldn't get anything else.

Mm. Mm! Audacious.

Mm. Look at the robe on that.

Mm. Ah, strawberry notes.

I'm getting caramel, I'm getting bitumen.

I'm getting red wine up my nose!

Notice anything different about me?

You've turned into a heron.

No.

Wait a minute, I've got it.
Your ears are bigger.

My hair! Isn't it perfect? Aren't I divine?

I'm more me than I've ever been.
I can't believe you didn't notice.

Men have a different way of noticing
hair. Which is not noticing it.

Gianni, my stylist,
only charged me 85 quid.

My stylist is free.
He's called Manicio.

I do it with a bread knife. Zip, zip, zip.

- I'm feeling a bit top-heavy.
- Ahh.

Mm. Mm. S...

Mm.

Why am I here,
wasting my hair on your eyes?

I should be getting slavishly admired.

Ah, but you will.
Because tonight... we go out.

- Why?
- Cos it's Friday.

It's Friday night.

It was Friday night last week
and it'll be Friday night every week

until we're dead and even then the
whole, rotten business will go on.

But it's Friday now
and we're here, young, alive.

- He's right. We should go out.
- What are the options?

- Erm... cinema.
- No smoking.

- Bowling.
- Can't do the shoe thing.

- Theatre.

What about a restaurant?
We could try Yo! Liver.

- I know of a party.
- What party?

- My friends John and Ann. Teachers.
- What's the place like?

Big kitchen/living room. Friendly place.

Right. So, it's a fridge-centred
25 to 40s party.

Chilli-shaped fairy lights,
beer in the bath.

Lots of yuppies, dinkies and yummies.

Lively fun but it won't
get out of hand. Yes, I'm listening.

- My hair says, ""Go, baby!""
- Yes!

- Sounds awful. How far is it?
- Two minutes.

Too far. We're not going.
We've got all we need here.

Oh, that means it's just us three again.

- We could sit in the garden.
- Garden?

There's a garden out the back.
I'm sure it's still there.

Come on.

Right, so you don't want
to sit in the garden.

We'll just have a nice glass of wine, OK?

There's more here somewhere.

Ooh, no. No, there isn't, Bernard.

Friday night, no booze.

Crisis. What can we do?

I know, we'll go to the party.
That's what we'll do!

I am picking up a certain keenness
from you about this party.

- There's no other reason to go?
- Absolutely not.

- Except there is a... girl.
- A what?

Girl. She's gonna be there.

I've met her before
and I was hoping to meet her again.

We don't have to wait for Bernard.

It has to be all three.
If I go with you and get talking to her,

then you'll be hovering, hovering.
And a girl gets awkward, awkward.

Because she thinks that
you and I are a thing, thing.

But all three of us go, then I catch
her eye, peel off, natural, natural.

We need Bernard to get to my person.

You know I don't approve
of you seeing other girls... people.

Who is she, this so-called person?

Rowena. She's a friend of Ann's.

Oh, I see. Ro-weena.

Ro-weeena.

And what am I supposed to do

when you do the underpants-Charleston
with this insane, blind tart?

Why are you so angry?

- I always get angry when I'm furious.
- It's no big deal.

Before you move to the country
to raise your bearded freak circus...

What's she like?
What are her prospects?

- She's nice.
- Oh, she's nice?

Don't make me get sick
into my own scorn.

Does she play the viola? Embroider?
Is she kind to the servants?

I just know that I like her.
And there's a chance she likes me.

- That's all.
- Right, we are going to this party.

Cos I'm trying to picture
this girl who likes you.

And all I can see is you in a dress.

- Come on, come on.
- Oh, oh, wait. We can't go yet.

- Why?
- I need my kit.

Kazoo. Snuff.

Thimbles. Amulet.

Swabs. Plums.

It's things to accidentally
leave behind, near to Rowena.

She'll find them later
and I can ring her up.

Can't you just ring and say,
""I'd like to see you again""?

Don't be stupid.
I don't want her to think I'm gay.

- Can we go now?
- Yeah. Let's par...

Don't you dare you the word ""party""
as a verb in this shop!

Let's p... otter along
in order to attend the party.

- Fran, get the wine.
- Sure.

What? Lies! Subterfuge!

Seething corruption!

Oi! You lot! Be quiet!

Shut up!

Is it here?
No. Here. You live... here.

The key won't go in the thing!

- Bernard, you're using your finger.
- Oh, yeah.

- My hair. Is my hair still good?
- Yeah, you're a vision.

See? I told you about hair power.

Three blokes put their phone numbers
into my new phone.

Look.

I'm dancing.

- Why aren't you dancing?
- There's no music.

Sing us a song, then. You're Irish.

That's what the Irish do
after a drink, isn't it?

What would I sing?

Mm... something about cliffs
and a girl with golden black hair.

And the English all being bad.

- Sing it yourself.
- Fine.

# Oh, Eamonn, Danny dear

- # I miss the Galway Bay

# And I'll sing for all I got

# And a riddle-diddle Dublin
and a riddle-diddle Donegal

# The English are all bollocks #

Oh, no. This is no good,
we need proper music.

Let's have a dancing competition.

I'll go first and then it's you, Manny, OK?

'# Pushing up the ante
I know you got to see me

- # Read 'em and weep... #
- I'm going next. That's rubbish.

I saw you at the party -
you embarrassed us.

- I'll have you any day.
- You can't do this.

# The ace of spades
the ace of spades #

Why would I want to do that?

Why would I want to when I can do this?

- Oh...

Oh...

Oh! What is this... I'm drinking?
It's disgu...

It's like a choc ice
fell into a bottle of bleach.

It's children's booze! What's yours?

Bludge. It's quite good, actually.
You don't even have to drink it.

You just rub it on your hips and
it eats right through to your liver.

- Manny, what's yours?
- Delicio's beetroot liqueur.

- Give us a bit. Swap, come on.
- No. It's mine!

Manny, don't be a baby.
It sounds nice. Pour some.

I'll have one with ice and on fire.

- Come on.
- It's mine. It's all mine!

- I'm gonna get blind drunk.
- Don't be silly.

- You'll regret it tomorrow.
- No!

Why are you always
bringing the mood down?

I didn't wanna leave that party,
it was great.

No, it wasn't! The music
was too loud, the food was cold.

The drinks were few
and the people many.

It was everything I expected.
And less.

I'm never going outside again
unless I need someplace to throw up.

Anyway, you got your chance with her.
What did you talk about?

Offshore wind farms.

I couldn't think of anything else.

Never mind. I'm sure you left
a bunsen burner behind.

You can get it tomorrow and propose.

No! I couldn't find
the right moment to plant anything.

She kept following me around, in
the kitchen, the bedroom, bathroom.

Every time I put something down,
""You dropped your kazoo.

""Ooh, you got snuff on your plums.""

A total waste of time.

Frankly, you're doomed.
You and all the shy people are.

Natural selection
favours the loud and aggressive.

I don't mean this in a bad way
but genetically you are... a cul-de-sac.

OK. OK, I tried.
All right? It didn't work.

At least I tried to make
a connection with another person.

When have you ever done that? Eh?

Exactly. You don't actually have a heart,
Bernard. Just a shard of ice.

- Flint.
- Sorry?

Flint. I always saw it as a piece of flint.

Oh. You don't see yourself as a human.

You... you... you're some kind of
superior species, aren't you?

Homo Bernardus. Scorning every fool
who believes in happiness.

Manny, shush.
This is the beetroot talking.

You don't know what love is.

You don't un... You don't know!

- I had a girlfriend. She died.
- And anyway... What?

That's right. Her name was Emma.

Somebody you barely know
knocked you back. Big deal.

I should be living with her by now.

Instead, every morning
I look through my cornflakes

to see your big,
mad, snaggle-toothed head.

So excuse me if I'm a bit...
out of sorts sometimes.

Would you like some beetroot liqueur?

You can have it.
You can have the whole bottle.

Really, I mean it.
You can have nearly all of it.

- Whoa! Don't go mad.
- I don't feel like a drink, anyway.

I'm making tea. Who wants tea?

That is the saddest story I've ever heard.
Poor Bernard.

The worst part of it is...

She isn't actually dead.
She lives the other side of Priory Road.

What?

Bernard told me about her
three years ago.

A year after that, I started doing
this exercise class run by a clown.

- Yeah?
- Circusise, it was called.

We had to wear
these really, really big shoes.

So the step stuff was really hard.

It was like this. It went...

Two, three, four.

Two, three, four.

And throw the bucket of water.

- Two, three...
- Yeah, Fran, Fran.

- Try to stick to the story.
- Oh, right. Yeah.

Afterwards, we'd go for a pizza.
One time, we talked about boyfriends.

This girl, she says
that she once got engaged

to this awful Irish guy...

called...

Bernard. The only way
she could think of getting out of it

was to get her friends
to say she was dead.

- But she wasn't... dead?
- No, Manny.

Which is why she was having
a pepperoni with extra cheese...

years later.

- Why haven't you told Bernard?
- Oh, I couldn't deal with all that.

Can you imagine? All the shouting
and the blaming. No, be very messy.

No, now, listen. Oi, you don't tell him.

- Don't you ever tell him.
- No.

- No, Manny, I mean it.
- I won't. I won't do it.

- Not even in ten or even 20 years.
- No, no way.

- No, no.
- What about a nice game of Monopoly?

Oh, yeah, that is a good idea.

Yeah. Yeah. OK, all right.
Here we go.

So, OK, Fran, you be the hat.
I'll be the dog and, Bernard, you...

She's alive! Bernard, she's alive!

Fran told me. Fran knows her!
Ask her. Ask Fran.

Emma lives in London.

Still. I'm sorry, Bernard.

- So, you're saying she must have...
- Yeah.

I don't believe you.

Well, look. She's in my phone.

That's her full name, isn't it?

I... I still don't believe you.

That's her and me at her last birthday.

One of the many she'll have,
still being alive.

Her dental records.

It can't be her!

OK. Here's her birth certificate.

I keep it safely inside
the envelope with the photo of her

reading yesterday's newspaper,

wearing an ""I love life"" T-shirt.

So. So... house rules as usual.

Fines in the middle.
If we throw three doubles...

- How long have you known this?
- Couple of years. Does it matter?

Oh! We all want Pall Mall, don't we?

- Who else knows?
- Nobody. Hardly anybody.

A few people.

Mr Singh at the newsagent's.
Oh, and your parents, I told them.

And I tell people at parties
if your name comes up.

Well, maybe I know
a few things about you.

- Maybe I've got a few little facts.
- I've thrown a seven! Beat that.

Manny doesn't know what name you
were born with. Have you met Enid?

N... Don't let's go down this road.

The letter you wrote to your mother
as part of the self-help programme?

You couldn't find it. I posted it.

Manny, you did get into
the Open University.

But Bernard tore up the letter.

I read your personal ad, I saw that.

""Intelligent, funny, 30-something female

""seeks solvent man for sex
and possible friendship.

""Sense of humour irrelevant.""

- I've been reading your short stories.
- That's different.

Ah, but it's good. Listen to this.

""Feared by men and admired by women,

""Brendan Blake turned
from the window and patted Larry,

""his barely hominoid, milk-fed gimp.""

You went to the party looking like that.

I think that covers everything.

- Hello?
- Rowena!

Hi. Hi.

- Hi.
- Hi.

We were talking at the party.

- Yes, hi, hi.
- Hi.

- And you left something behind.
- Did I?

You were drinking out of this.

I thought maybe
you wanted to keep the cup.

So I asked Ann where you lived and...
But you're busy.

- I'm sorry. I'm stupid.
- No, no, no.

Thanks for bringing it.

I'm really, really pleased
that you came round... with... it.

Oh, for Christ's sake!

Well... thanks. Thanks.
I'll just put that there.

Safe and sound.

So... Erm...

- That's about it, really.
- Right. Right.

Well, th... thanks for...
er, bringing it round.

Offer her something, you fool.

Oh. Oh. S-Seeing as you're here,
would you like some tea or coffee?

Or Bovril? Or a herbal coffee?

- Tea's nice.
- Tea! Coming up.

I'll help you make it.

Aah. Good for Manny.

I'm sorry, I should've told you
about Emma but she asked me not to.

I was too good for her, anyway.

She had arms like a stevedore.
Stay and have a drink, will you?

Oh, no, no. I've gotta go home.

I'm not sleeping in the skip again.

I'll just lie down, just to rest my eyes.

I've got a date tomorrow.

I've gotta look nice.

Could I talk with Emma... Oh, it's you. Hi.

Yes. That's right. That's right, it's me.

I'm very well, th... Actually, no, I'm dead.

That's right, actually, physically dead.
Not funny now, is it?

I'm haunting you, that's what I'm doing.

Well, why don't you f...

You can't hang up on the undead!

Shut up!

Did you want something?

Yes, I want not to hear any
squawking or squeaking or squealing

and if I do
I'll throw you both into the street.

Right.

Nighty-night.

Is that your ass or your mama half reindeer?
I can't explain it but damn sure glad you came here
I'm still a sucker for cornrows, you know I never changed that
Your body is banging mama, but where your brains at?
I'm still the same cat when I was younger running with bad boys
But now I'm on the hook and so I'm running with Bad Boy
Here come another man, unlike no other man
Candy coated (what!) switching every other lane
Lord help me, why don't cha please help me
Eighth girl this week and it's only Tuesday

Black, white and Dominicans

All before the drama begun
When we first met
I seen you sitting out on your steps
You was broke down crying a mess
So I interferred
I asked what's the reason for tears
I was wishing you could tell me your fears
But I'll start with ya name
You told me how ya man playin games
So I said that it was time for a change
And you just laughed
But it looked like you ain't laughed in while
I was glad that I could give you a smile
Then we both blushed
But really girl it ain't no rush
I was thinking maybe we can discuss
A future for us
Cause homeboy just got you crushed
You need to leave that clown in the dust
Trust, I just wanna talk
I'm thinking I can give you a call
And we can pick it up
Where we left off
I'll holla tomorrow

Girl I understand you loyal to ya man
And that's alright aww baby
But that don't change the fact

Nah baby
Can't ya see
Together you and me could be so special ah baby

[Verse 2]
Our feelings get greater
A million days later
Talking all night we stay up but
Here comes ya ex
Returned with that drama and stress
All the nonsense that you just left but yet
You except and go back to try it again
Then return with a broken heart
That I gotta mend
That's unfair
I've only been your lover and friend
And homey there he just front and pretend
But you don't care the life he leads is unsafe
I would never place my hands to your face
But still I chase
Cat and mouse
First you kick him out
Then you at his house
What is that about
I can't figure you out
Even your friend said I was better
But you listen to him
Never like uh-uh whatever
So the next time hurt you again
You already knew where you should've been

And lead me through the fire
Be the long awaited answer

But somewhere 'long the way
I got caught up in all there was to offer
And the cost was so much more than I could bear

When love was raw and young
We believe that we can change ourselves
The past can be undone
But we carry on our back the burden time always reveals
In the lonely light of morning
In the wound that would not heal
It's the bitter taste of losing everything
That I've held so dear

So don't come 'round here
And tell me ""I told you so""

That it's one missed step, one slip before you know it

And she was just about to cry
Until I took her in my arms
And I tried not to let her see me laugh
Yeah I live for little moments like that

I know she's not perfect
But she tries so hard for me
And I thank god that she isn't
Cause how boring would that be
It's the little imperfections
It's the sudden change in plans
When she misreads the directions
And we're lost but holding hands
Yeah I live for little moments like that

[Verse 4]
When she's laying on my shoulder
On the sofa in the dark
And about the time she falls asleep
So does my right arm
And I want so bad to move it

But she looks so much like an angel

Put on my blue suede shoes and I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain

And I'm blue as a boy can be

Saw the ghost of Elvis
Down on Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
And watched him walk right through
Now security they did not see him
They just hovered 'round his tomb
There's a pretty little thing
Waitin' on ""The King""
Down in the Jungle Room

[Chorus]
Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

They've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
You got a prayer in Memphis

[Verse 3]
Now Muriel plays the piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
She said
""Tell me are you a Christian""
And I said ""Ma'am I am tonight""

Some chimps are swinging from a vine
Some chimps in jackboots

A pair of Dutch chimps
Who send their love from Amsterdam

If I had to guess, I'd say the monkey-sender thinks its great
He's sending me, maybe she's sending me, just to see me get irate
I'm losing sleep and it's gonna be keeping me up all night
I thought it was funny but now I got money on a monkey-fight

Some chimps in hard-hats

Some chimps who love cats
Burning rubber in a Mustang
A birthday wishing chimp
A chimp in black, like a goth
A going fishing chimp
A British chimp in the bath

Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
[Verse 2]
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God He hears you
And I pray to God He hears you, and

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 3]
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up, would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?""
He said, ""Will you defeat them, your demons
And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer to join the black parade""
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up, would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?""
[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times, I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

[Chorus]
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

[Verse 2]
A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, and let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end, we hear the call

And though you're dead and gone, believe me

You was doing too much, I wasn't doing enough
That's what your friends are saying you got a man anyway
I can't explain it neither, I ain't never wanna leave ya
Hell yeah, it's hard to walk away when I see you
When I see you, I remember the day
You put your shoes on and moved on before I could say

I saw you with your new girl just yesterday
And I feel that I must confess
Even though it kills me to have to say
I'll admit that I was impressed
Physically just short of perfection
Gotta commend you on your selection
Though I know I shouldn't be concerned
In the back of my mind, I can't help but question

(Scratch your scalp) When you take out your braids

Now little Lisa's only nine years old
She's tryin to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone and they never met her family
Momma's always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin and nobody'll listen
Momma's on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen
Bringin home men at different hours of the night
Startin with some laughs, usually endin in a fight
Sneakin in her room when her momma's knocked out
Tryin to have his way and little Lisa says ouch
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her momma don't believe her
Lisa's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get some clothes and pack

Where the bullies of time increase your pain
My niggas count the money and pray the god
Pray the god to see tomorrow one more time
Mo hours mo minutes mo distress
Time is a poison which acts so slowly
No caress ,no kisses ,for the realest
Just blow,just cuts and that's it

My back 'gainst the wall
Hours all around me
My reason insensitive
But my heart feeling something

Time is so fast

Time is in the same time my richness and my huge poverty
Minutes gives a rough ra to my pore head to my eyes man to my conscious to my reason
Im feelin the time ,im feelin the punch

Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blonde tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot a whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

[Chorus]
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats
[Verse 2]
Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying, ""I'm drunk""
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know

[Chorus]
Oh, that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

I might've saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me

To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas

What you get is what you got

They humpin' like when it's over, we gon' all get into somethin'
The Dogg is fresh, Southside without a vest
Nothin on my chest but these ladies up out the Midwest
I must confess that in the Chi you're so blessed
Leaving nothing on my mind but Doggy, you and safe sex
This ain't a test, you fucking with a cold mess
Meet me in Chicago, let me get you to this real west
It's real strong, real fat and real long
Doggies in the building, holdin' something they can feel up on
And once they get it something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home, work that filling till it's gone
Get that home grown, put that shit on Daddy long
I know how you ladies do it, t-shirt with no panties on
Let's get this shit crackin', Kell and Doggy Dogg in action
If you in here all alone, you might get this dog bone

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like ""That's that shit""
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like ""That's that shit""

Let me hear you say ""That's that shit""

Dippin' low, '64, hundred spokes and chronic smoke
All these ladies on the floor cause they know what we in here for
Dogg and Kelly came to ball, get your ass up off the wall
Let that middle wiggle now make that shit fall
Not just one but all y'all, move it like you want it all
Let me see you bounce it for me, work that shit for Doggy Dogg
You gots to do it, is that your crew?
Bring 'em too, come here let me take you through it
Then once Kelly get into it, we can get this after party
Poppin' everybody, got themselves another body
Knockin' out without protection though, that's my confession
But at the spot if you just think you want a lesson, you can drop it like it's hot
Hold up, I came to cool out, lay back and get blown
Maybe Henny, maybe gin, a couple shots of Patron
And if you didn't you missed it but now it's known
That this that shit, Kels sing that song, come on

Remember it's just different from what you've seen

Mafioso rap veterans Ghostface, AZ and Kool G take their adulthood experiences and apply them to the metaphorical battlefield. Never forget - there's a war going on outside.99.

Vic Mensa	""Feel That""Following his breakout mixtape Innanetape and four appearances on last year’s top 100 song list, Vic Mensa is back with his Smoko Ono produced banger ""Feel That"". The song breaks away from Vic’s reputation as a “lyrical” rapper, substituting lyrical complexity for a strong flow and crazy energy. Vic’s about to take over the game and we feel that!94.

PRyhme ""Courtesy"" In classic Premo style, the production is lead by organs and 90's scratched vocal samples. Royce blesses us with two thrilling verses - snarky shots at his competition, sprinkled pop culture references, and packed wordplay. Rapping well is the only way he knows how, and it proves true on this record.89. Childish Gambino ""Sober""88. NehruvianDOOM ""OM""87. Drake	""How About Now""86.

Jay Z ""We Made It Freestyle"" Jay Electricity and Hova joined forces at the top of the  year to murder Drake & Soulja Boy’s 2013 New Year anthem “We Made It”. The chemistry is undeniable as the two flow effortlessly over the blaring horns. While both dropped serious knowledge on The Five Percent Nation of Islam, every line packs a punch. Exhibit A? Jigga hitting Drizzy square in the jaw with this right hook: “Sorry Mrs. Drizzy for so much art talk/Silly me rappin' 'bout shit that I really bought”79. Beyonce ft.

Dej Loaf	""Try Me""From the moment the muted twinkles of DDS’ “Try Me” beat creeps in, Dej commands the year’s most threatening anthem without ever raising her voice past a Cam’ronian monotone. It runs like a checklist of guaranteed hip-hop success. Hook? Infectious. Flow? Unique, yet copyable by the lay listener. Lyrics? Quotable. But what exalts this song to its heights is Dej Loaf’s undeniable, next-level swagger, one that makes her one rapper you really might not want to try.74. Young Thug ft. A$AP Ferg & Freddie Gibbs ""Old English""73. Lil Wayne ft. The LOX ""Gotti""72. Mick Jenkins ""The Waters""71. Game ""Bigger Than Me""70. Childish Gambino ""Candler Road""Bino pays homage to a road in his hometown in Decatur, Atlanta, a fitting name for an instrumental that contains an interpolation of his because the internet song “Telegraph Ave.” The improvised scat hook puts a cherry on top of the seemingly effortless track that stands out as his best rap song of the year.69. Wu-Tang Clan ""Ruckus In B Minor""68. Kendrick Lamar ""Untitled""67. OG Maco ""U Guessed It""66. Drake ""Draft Day""65. Donnie Trumpet ft.

Whether it’s the soul-filled vocals from Jamila Woods & Co, or Chance the Rapper’s two verses, nostalgia oozes out of every corner of this joint. With live instrumentation and composition by SoX, this release sets expectations high for their album SURF.64. ScHoolboy Q ""Hoover Street""63. Common ft. Vince Staples ""Kingdom""62. Jay Rock ""Parental Advisory""61. Freddie Gibbs ""Shitsville""60. Action Bronson ""Easy Rider""The psych-rock sampling accompanies Bronsolino's timeless flow like a hot dog at the ball game. Gems like “I had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans. Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin” are classic Bam Bam. ""Easy Rider"" is Mr. Wonderful's acid trip on steroids.59. Eminem	""Shady XV""58. Nicki Minaj ""Anaconda""57. J.Cole ""January 28th""56. Run The Jewels ft. boots ""Early""55. Mac Miller ""Diablo""Mac hit us with “Diablo”  on his Soundcloud account out of nowhere in February. The chilling piano line and Mac's delivery perfectly complement lyrics like “Contemplating suicide like it’s a DVD / Lost inside my mind, it’s a prison homie leave me be”. The druggy philosopher we all fell in love with is back, and trippier than ever. 54. Freddie Gibbs ""Harold's""53. Slaughterhouse ""Y'all Ready Know""52. Logic ""Nikki""51. Yelawolf ""Till It's Gone""50. Pharoahe Monch ft. Black Thought ""Rapid Eye Movement""From the moment the first bar is spat, you know Pharoahe and Tariq aren't strangers to the rap game. ""My think tank's like a piranha tank think, multiple bites figure / Mega, reality, tera, giga"" starts us off with a bang. ""Rapid Eye Movement"" sounds like it belongs in a James Bond movie49. PartyNextDoor ft. Drake ""Recognize""48. Vic Mensa ""Down On My Luck""47. PRyhme	""PRyhme""46. Vince Staples ""Blue Suede""45. Rae Sremmurd	""No Flex Zone""Serving as Rae Sremmurd's debut single, this anthem quickly blew up the charts, clubs and streets to make the oddly named duo the biggest thing in hip hop. In fact, this track was so big that the remix featured two of the hottest rappers in recent times: Nicki Minaj and Pusha T44. Nicki Minaj ft. Chris Brown, Drake & Lil Wayne ""Only"" 43. Joey Bada$$	""Big Dusty""42. Run The Jewels ""Blockbuster Night Pt. 1""41. Big K.R.I.T.	""Cadillactica""40. Pusha T ""Lunch Money""What started as an accidental release turned out to be one of the best joints of the year. The G.O.D laid down the Contra style soundtrack, while King Push’s flow was flawless. The drug dealer dichotomy did it again with lines like “What's the price of success? Lost my bitch, bought a chef”. This initial offering has us fiending for King Push, and unlike 2013’s MNIMN, he won’t need a pitch either - the shit sells itself.39. YG ft. Drake ""Who Do You Love""38. Freddie Gibbs ""Deeper""37. Mac Miller ft. Da$h & Earl Sweatshirt ""New Faces V2""36. Rae Sremmurd ""No Type""35. Isaiah Rashad ""Heavenly Father""Here Isaiah Rashad delivers dark content over a soulful instrumental, creating a nice contrast between the two. A combination of Rashad's smooth, low-tempo flow, and a melodic hook from SZA, makes this for a heavenly performance. One of the best cuts from Cilvia Demo.34. Wiz Khalifa ""We Dem Boyz""33. J.Cole ""No Role Modelz""32. Future ft. Casino, Pharrell Williams & Pusha T ""Move That Dope""31. Logic ""Soul Food""30. Eminem ft. Big Sean, Danny Brown, Dej Loaf, Royce Da 5'9 & Trick Trick ""Detroit Vs Everybody"" Detroit up-and-comers Big Sean and Danny Brown come hard enough to successfully bridge the gap between Royce and Em’s bookend verses. Between another show-stealing verse from Royce, a solid hook from Dej Loaf, and an outro from the director of the “No Fly Zone” Trick Trick, this track should keep rival MCs wary of Detroit static for time to come.29. Jay Rock ft. Chantal Kreviazuk & Kendrick Lamar ""Pay For It""28. Nas ""The Season""27. Bad Meets Evil ""Vegas""26. Logic ""Gang Related""25. Freddie Gibbs ft. Danny Brown ""High""Gangster Gibbs brings Danny on a marijuana-filled trip, backed with smooth and bass-banging production courtesy of Madlib. Getting high is what they do best, and it's no surprise hearing how well both of them sound on this joint. As expected, Danny's excited and high-registered verse flows perfectly with the beat as Freddie refuses to extinguish the fire.24. T.I ft. Young Thug ""About The Money""23. Drake ""6 God""22. Eminem ft. Sia ""Guts Over Fear""21. Run The Jewels ft. Zack de la Rocha  ""Close Your Eyes (And Count To Fuck)""20. Mick Jenkins ""Jazz"" Mick rides the beat using his notorious voice conviction skills, and as the beat mellows, his voice mellows; as the beat gets more chaotic, his voice rises. The lyrics, flow, and overall vibe of the song hits your soul and makes a new home. Mick wants us to ignore the lies and corruption in the world - and we already know that this black man ain’t talkin’ all that Jazz.19. Young Jeezy ft. Jay Z ""Seen It All""Two of hip hop's most renowned hustlers join forces yet again and the result is nothing short of astonishing. The track is a clear highlight on Jeezy's album and one of Jay's finest verses in recent memory. They are both in top form as they vividly depict the experiences of their past drug dealings. You can clearly tell there's a genuine chemistry between the two. Even if you say this song blows - that's still a compliment. It was so real Jay was brought to tears while writing his verse.18. Rick Ross ft. Big Sean & Kanye West ""Sanctified""Ross gruntFeaturing Big Sean and Kanye West in addition to production by DJ Mustard and West, ""Sanctified"" was easily the most anticipated track from Rozay's 6th album, Mastermind. While Kanye's verse was a PSA to the critics who continually attempt to tarnish his reputation, Ross rapped about grilled cheese and his Rolls Royce Wraith.

Not only did ""Sanctified"" appear #1 on our Top 10 Beats of 2014 list, but it served as the background music for the greatest viral video of all time17. ILOVEMAKONNEN ft. Drake ""Tuesday (Remix)""I Love Makonnen began 2014 as a relatively unknown artist struggling to gain relevance as a musician, and trying to break free from his manslaughter charges. Then one day...Drizzy decided to drop a verse onto “Tuesday” and nothing was the same. Makonnen sings about his drug dealing past, and his busy schedule forcing him to bend the rules of when clubs can go up. Thanks to this single, clubs will never be the same on a Tuesday.16. J.Cole 	""Wet Dreamz""Over a classic sample, Cole gives us his vintage story telling as he reminisces about his first time with a girl. He holds a cool attitude as tells the girl he's a pro - even though he's never had sex before. As thing escalate further, he watches porn videos for pointers and practices putting on a condom before the plot takes a twist right at the end. What's scary is how well this song relates. We guarantee almost every male listener felt some type of way. 15. Lil Wayne ft. Drake ""Believe Me"" The release of ""Believe Me""  raised Tha Carter V's hype up few notches thanks to the perfect combination of YMCMB's finest. Drake lays down the hook and two stylistically different verses; one that bounces perfectly with the Boi-1da-produced beat, and another with a gritty flow. Wayne matches Drake verse-for-verse and ends the track in memorable fashion

One of the more underrated aspects of ""Believe Me""  is its versatility. You can bump it while you’re browsing Genius, driving to work or school, or grinding through a workout. It appeals to all ears, just as we hope the entire album will.14. ScHoolboy Q ""Break tHe Bank""Complete with a chilling piano line and a Mario Kart 64 sample from The Alchemist, the instrumental is perfect for a modern gangster rapper like ScHoolboy Q. Throughout the track he viciously reminds the listener that it's his time and that he ain't no one to fuck with. With Oxymoron debuting at number one on the billboard charts, and having sold over 320,000 copies, it is safe to say that Q is Breaking the bank. 13. A$AP Rocky ft. Juicy J ""Multiply""After some uncharacteristic features, A$AP returned with one of the hardest hitting songs of the year in ""Multiply."" The Flacko flow is on full display from the start; his signature internal rhyming bounces up and down on the beat with such rhythm that it wouldn’t matter if he used to sell crack or lemonade in his living room

Don’t worry, you won’t be seeing an A$AP Lemonade Stand anytime soon as Rocky sticks to his typical rapper and fashion references. Throw in some Juicy J trash talk for good measure and A$AP’s only single since Long.Live.A$AP is one of the year’s best. Swag swag.12. Flying Lotus ft. Kendrick Lamar ""Never Catch Me""Like a psychedelic rat race, “Never Catch Me”  has Kendrick Lamar running circles around this Flying Lotus masterpiece. The fusion of hip hop, jazz, & electronic styles has Kendrick spazzing like a rabid dog. The L.A natives take you on an outer body experience to stare death right in the face. Every few bars the instrumental changes as the race continues, like Kendrick’s searching for something, getting faster, and faster, and as you reach your destination - “bitch, you’re dead!”11. Joey Bada$$ ""Christ Conscious (Toroidal Flow)""With an aggressive flow, Joey delivers a barrage of punchlines, wordplay, and utter energy that dazzles any listener. The beauty of these lyrical acrobats continues to prolong Joey’s ability and shows he ain’t no slacker when it comes down to the lyrics. Dragon Balls like his name was Vegeata, BADA$$  swears that no matter what, he won’t stop until he reaches the level of Christ Conscious.10. Run The Jewels ""Oh My Darling Don't Cry"" Anchored by an El-P instrumental that can only be described as manic, the dynamic duo laces the beat with rhymes that are crude, insightful, and simultaneously both. What separates it from other RTJ tracks is the erosion in differences between the styles and personalities of the lead rappers. On RTJ1, Mike and El were characterized as aggressive and philosophical, respectively. But here El has no problem telling you to “run backwards through a field of dicks” as Mike peruses Egyptian scriptures. The chemistry is palpable, the flows are indescribable, and the result is one of the highlights of 2014.9. Rich Gang ft. Birdman, Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug ""Lifestyle"" EUUGHBLAHBEAHELGWLINAHDEWFQLFKQWFN LLLLLLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFFFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEEEEEESTYLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEFor a song that made many detractors reconsider Rich Homie Quan’s “one-hit wonder status” and mainstream listeners delve into the Young Thug archives, the unintelligible nature of the lyrics for most listeners was its greatest asset: whatever personal details you added over the beat, you felt like your efforts were putting you on the fast-track to a Dionysian lifestyle of your own.8. ScHoolboy Q ft. BJ The Chicago Kid ""Studio""ScHoolboy Q put his heart on his sleeve in this banger for the ladies, elaborating on the reality that life as a major musician can be hectic. From touring around the world to TV appearances to, in this case, late nights in the studio, it can be hard to balance a relationship with a busy work schedule.7. J.Cole ""Fire Squad""If shock factor was what Cole was after with ""Fire Squad"" then he certainly achieved it. After boasting of his greatness in the first two verses, he took an interesting approach: highlighting white appropriation in the music of black culture. Not only did he just observe the sound-jacking, he name dropped some of the most well-known artists to ever do it.6. Bobby Shmurda ""Hot Nigga""The relationship between artist and subject matter, in the hip-hop and r&b genres especially, is a dangerously liminal one. When Rick Ross gets chastised for portraying a criminal mastermind following his career in law enforcement, are we supposed to then turn around and congratulate Bobby Shmurda and his crew for their string of summer smashes for existing in a realm of authenticity? It wasn’t the lyrics, nor the beat (on its second go-around, no less!) that made Bobby so hot. So when the chant-worthy one-liners become appear as more than fiction, should we cheer? Should we scold? Or should we Shmoney Dance the troubles away?!5. Logic ""Under Pressure""The title track of the album is reminiscent of Logic’s classic brag pieces, entailing his recent rise in popularity and success. Where the initial four-minute release dropped off is the track’s elegant yet radical style shift - it transitions from his recent material success to a deeply introspective track reflecting on both his past and current state of affairs with family. This track serves as the crown jewel of the album - a diamond created from being under pressure.4. Big Sean ft. E-40 ""I Don't Fuck With You""Sean Don and Bay Area godfather E-40 went big this year with the anthem for those without fucks to give. This track dropped along with “Paradise”, “4th Quarter”, and “Jit/Juke"" through his website following the announcement of his signing to Roc Nation. The song samples “Say You Love Me”, as part of the exemplary accompaniment of Coach Kanye and DJ Mustard on the beat. His blatantly vulgar lyrics clearly express his lack of interest in those he is not ""down with"" and is reminiscent of “I Don’t Give A Fuck” from Bo$$. While it has been confirmed that the record is not meant to be a shot to anyone in particular (including Naya Rivera with whom he recently split,) the message is still….Who ever I don't fuck with, I still don't fuck with you.3. Big K.R.I.T.	""Mt. Olympus""Post KRIT's 2013 release, King Remembered In Time, more verbal lightning from Krizzle became high in demand, and he delivered. ""Mt. Olympus"" sees K.R.I.T. punish all the heathens of the rap game, showing them there really is a god. The fans wonder, ""Is he rap, is he snap?"". ""Is he bass, is he drank?"" Neither - he is a King Remembered in Time.2. Drake ""0-100/The Catch Up""If there's one thing we've learned, it's that every song really does sound like Drake featuring Drake. ""Started from the bottom, now we here"" may have been 2013's catchphrase, but ""0 to 100 nigga, real quick"" took 2014 over almost as quickly as fans grabbed the free Soundcloud download of this track after its June release

The two-part track is a variety pack, filled with braggadocio, meme-worthy lines, and introspective thoughts. What makes ""0 to 100/The Catch Up"" so notable is the instantaneous shift from straight fire bars to a calmer profession of the same sentiment: Drake is perched at the top of the rap game and he's only getting better. That's a scary thought. We've already begun to see Drake back up these claims in his latest releases, and it's safe to say the anticipation for his next full-length project is nearly off the charts.1. Kendrick Lamar ""i""Backed by funky production reminiscent of the wonder years of soul music, Kendrick broadcasts a message of self love.  The best messages are those easily understood, and Kendrick makes no mistakes with a simple ""I love myself""

Similar to our number one song last year, Kanye West's ""New Slaves"", every facet of the song’s concept was handled in one spectacularly orchestrated move. Whether it be the record, the music video, or the buzz - each element illustrates the message crystal clear. An anthem isn't created overnight, this song has been in Kendrick all his life. They can lock ya body, they can’t trap ya mind.

You'll find that they're quite stationary
All of my action figures are cherry

Driving through town
Just my boy and me
With a happy meal in his booster seat
Knowing that he couldn't have the toy
'Till his nuggets were gone
A green traffic light turned straight to red
I hit my brakes and mumbled under my breath
His fries went a-flying and his orange drink covered his lap
Well then my four year old said a four letter word
That started with ""S"" and I was concerned
So I said, ""Son now where did you learn to talk like that?""
[Chorus]
He said ""I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool?
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
We got cowboy boots and camo pants
Yeah we're just alike, hey ain't we dad?
I wanna do everything you do

We got back home and I went to the barn
I bowed my head and I prayed real hard
Said, ""Lord please help me help my stupid self""
Then this side of bedtime later that night
Turning on my son's Scooby Doo nightlight
He crawled out of bed and he got down on his knees
He closed his little eyes, folded his little hands
And spoke to God like he was talking to a friend

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie""
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

[Chorus]
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
[Verse 2]
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

[Chorus]
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Bridge]
And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:
""When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place""

We just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, mi nemesis es su nemesis
Same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl
And we all get involved in it
And we should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge of honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holdin'
The most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over
But tonight, we ain't come in here to beef with nobody

Let's pretend for a second you don't know who I am
And what I do, lets just put it do the side
I can feel your heart beating, I can hear you breathing
Look into your eyes, try to see into your mind
See into your soul, see no limits, to the levels me and you can go
When it's me that is in control
But it's something 'bout you that make me wanna change
I like the way you dance and the way you play the game
I like the way you take away the pain
The way you tell me that you want it, not saying a thing
The way you got me going got me goin' out of my brain
See us going at it, goin in and out of them lanes
I don't want your innocence, I don't want you to stutter
I don't want a commitment, and I don't want you to suffer
I don't want your number
Baby I want you to wonder
Want you to come up lookin like it's somethin' you wanna

Crème de la crème, homie, top shelf you know

Ayy holla if you like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black

[Verse 1]
I'm the man in my city ain't nobody fucking wit me
You can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches
I'm a known drug dealer I always have 50's
And the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me
SS'S on 26's watching some television
Shorty I'm never slipping got the Beretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping
Pimp stole the automobile and the roof for the tag missing
Polices' try to pursue me it's nothing but gas given
Addicted to fast living, guess I'm one of my dad's children
Think I'm bad now, you should've seen me before I had children
Give dick to your daddy's daughter and dare her to have children
Hope he got some insurance cause death her ass is enduring
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her ass to Missouri
Still my wet paint drippin' while I'm woodgrain gripping

Or the fliest Spur in Cali fucking Hollywood Ho's

I wear the crown down under man somebody better tell 'em
'Fore I spit a hundred rounds and have everybody bailing
I got some bitches in a Benz and my partners in the Chevy
And now we riding Giovanni's and Asani's on Pirellis
If you ever think of trying to run up on me just forget it
The clip in the chopper long as ya leg and leave ya shredded
Pistol way in the truck got my knife on tuck
You think he ain't getting stuck, you got life fucked up
A couple stitches in ya hip will have your night fucked up
Will he live? Will he die? Guess he might luck up
Meanwhile, I'm racing my Ferrari like a light for a buck
Against Lamborghini Gallardos every time I get a car

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I heard motherfuckers sayin' they made Hov
Made Hov say, ""Okay, so? Make another Hov!""
Niggas wasn't playin' they day role
So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo
I shoulda been did it but I been in a daze though
I put friends over business end of the day though
But when friends' business interests is Day Glow
Ain't nothin' left to say though, I guess we forgot what we came fo'
Shoulda stayed in food and beverage
Too much flossin', too much Sam Rothstein
I ain't a bitch but I gotta divorce them
Hov had to get the shallow shit up off him
And I ain't even want to be famous
Niggas is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
And I ain't even know how it came to this
Except that fame is the worst drug known to man
It's stronger than, heroin
When you could look in the mirror like, ""There I am""
And still not see what you've become
I know I'm guilty of it too, but not like them; you lost one
[Chorus: Chrisette Michele  & Jay-Z]
Lose one, let go to get one (One, one, one)

I don't think it's meant to be, B
For she loves her work more than she does me
And honestly, at twenty-three
I would probably love my work more than I did she
So, we ain't we, it's me and her
'Cause what she prefers over me is work
And that's where we differ
So I have to give her free time, even if it hurts
So, breathe, mami, it's deserved
You've been put on this Earth to be all you can be like the Reserves
And me? My time in the army, it's served
So I have to allow she her time to serve
The time's now for her, in time she'll mature
And maybe we can be we again like we were
Finally, my time's too short to share
And to ask her now it ain't fair, so yeah, she lost one

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele  & Jay-Z]
Lose, one, let go to get one (One, one, one)

Can't run from the pain, go towards it
Some things can't be explained, what caused it?
Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit!
Gonna see you again, I'm sure of it
'Til that time, little man, I'm nauseous

Almost lost my faith, that restored it

That sank when I fell overboard
My ship would leave the country
But I'd rather swim ashore
Without a life vest, I'd be stuck again
Wish I was much more masculine
Maybe then I could learn to swim

Let the hurricane set in motion, yeah

Where is the coastguard?
I keep looking each direction
For a spotlight, give me something
I need something for protection
Maybe flotsam junk will do just fine
The jetsam sunk, I'm left behind
I'm treading for my life believe me
(How can I keep up this breathing?)
Not knowing how to think
I scream aloud, begin to sink
My legs and arms are broken down
With envy for the solid ground
I'm reaching for the life within me
How can one man stop his ending?

My strings all get tangled, my wires all get crossed
Every now and then I'm right up on the edge
Dangling my toes out over the ledge
I just thank God you're here

Cause when I'm a bullet shot out of a gun

Or when I'm a fugitive ready to run, all wild-eyed and crazy
No matter where my reckless soul takes me
Baby you save me

It's hard loving' a man that's got a gypsy soul
I don't know how you do it, I'm not sure how you know
The perfect thing to say to save me from myself
You're the angel that believes in me like nobody else
And I thank God you do

Cause when I'm a bullet shot out of a gun
When I'm a firecracker coming undone

I know I don't tell you nearly enough
That I couldn't live one day without your love
When I'm a ship tossed around on the waves
Up on a high wire that's ready to break
When I've had just about all I can take
Baby you, baby you save me

And they don’t question what I say cause I’m a ladies pimp
See this little one right here this fellow got stripes
And I is represent, my rail room for life
Money in my pocket but I still act trife
While I in da club they say the parlor a’int right

Hustlin’ hard all day that’s the way I live

The sky's alive with a burning light
You can mark my words something's about to break

And I found myself in a bitter fight
While I've held your hand through the darkest night
Don't know where you're coming from but you're coming soon

To a kid from Oregon by way of California
All of this is more than I've ever known or seen
Come on and we'll sing, like we were free
Push the pedal down, watch the world around fly by us
Come on and we'll try, one last time
I'm off of the floor one more time to find you

And here we go, there's nothing left to choose
And here we go, there's nothing left to lose

So I packed my car and I headed east
Where I felt your fire and a sweet release
There's a fire in these hills, that's coming now

And I don't know much but I found you here
And I cannot wait another year
Don't know where you're coming from, but you're coming soon

To a kid from Oregon by way of California
All of this is more than I've ever known or seen

Come on and we'll sing, like we were free
Push the pedal down, watch the world around fly by us
Come on and we'll try, one last time
I'm off of the floor one more time to find you

And here we go, there's nothing left to choose

This snowman is shaping up to be an eight
But not out of ten
The robots awake to find that they've been taped down
Wondering when
They'll break through these chains
But little boys have action toys for brains
I'm living proof it can last a long time

[Verse 2: Brandon Flowers]
Now the girls off the street are innocent and sweet
When they're all in bed
They got their make-up and dreams of wonderland
Sprinkled inside their heads
And soon they will change
But tonight, Hollywood has never seemed so strange
Now mothers pray it'll last a long time
[Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
I want to roll around like a kid in the snow
I want to relearn what I already know
Just let me take flight, dressed in red
Through the night, on a great big sled

I want to wish you Merry Christmas
Ho, ho, ho

[Verse 3: Brandon Flowers]
Now the boys are all grown up
And they're working their fingers to the bone
They go around chasing them girls on the weekend
You know they still can't be alone
And I've been racking my brain
With thoughts of peace and love
How on earth did we get so mixed up?
I pray to God it don't last a long time

Look at the two of you dancing that way
Lost in the moment and each other's face
So much in love your alone in this place
Like there's nobody else in the world
I was enough for her not long ago
I was her number one, she told me so
And she still means the world to me
Just so you know
So be careful when you hold my girl
Time changes everything
Life must go on
And I'm not going to stand in your way
[Chorus]
But I loved her first, I held her first
And a place in my heart will always be hers
From the first breath she breathed
When she first smiled at me
I knew the love of a father runs deep
And I prayed that she'd find you someday
But it still hard to give her away
I loved her first

[Verse 2]
How could that beautiful woman with you
Be the same freckle face kid that I knew
The one that I read all those fairy tales to
And tucked into bed all those nights
And I knew the first time I saw you with her
It was only a matter of time

But I loved her first and I held her first
And a place in my heart will always be hers

Bad boy to the bone

Narrow mind, full of hate
On the road to nowhere fast
Till the Grace of God got in the way

And cried and said a prayer
Rose up a brand new man
Left the old one right there

They come from every state to find
Some dreams were meant to be declined
Tell the man, what did you have in mind?
What have you come to do?
No turning water into wine
No learning while you're in the line
I'll take you to the broken sign
You see, these lights are blue

[Bridge 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Come and get it, lost it at the city limit
Say goodbye, 'cause they will find a way to trim it
Everybody lookin' for a silly gimmick
Gotta get away, can't take it for another minute
[Pre-Chorus 1: Anthony Kiedis]
This town is made of many things
Just look at what the current brings
So high, it's only promising
This place was made on you

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Tell me, baby, what's your story?
Where you come from and where you wanna go this time? Aw
Tell me, lover, are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, aw
Tell me, baby, what's your story?
Where do you come from and where you wanna go this time? Aw
You're so lovely, are you lonely?
Oh, giving up on the innocence you left behind

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Some claim to have the fortitude
Too shrewd to blow the interlude
Sustaining pain to set a mood
Step out to be renewed
I'll move you like a baritone
Jungle Brothers on the microphone
Getting over with an undertone
It's time to turn to stone

If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

I hold out for one more drink, before I think
I'm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun, I should just stay home
If one thing really means one
This club will hopefully be closed in three weeks

Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
No matter what you say about love
I keep coming back for more
Keep my hand in the fire
Sooner or later, I get what I'm askin' for
No matter what you say about life
I learn every time I bleed
The truth is a stranger, soul is in danger
I gotta let my spirit be free
[Pre-Chorus]
To admit that I'm wrong
And then change my mind
Sorry, but I have to move on
And leave you behind

[Chorus]
I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back at a new direction
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
Just like a tattoo
I'll always have you (I'll always have you)
(I'll always have you)

[Verse 2]
I'm sick of playing all of these games
It's not about taking sides
When I looked in the mirror
It didn't deliver

[Pre-Chorus]
It hurt enough to think that I could stop
Admit that I'm wrong, and then change my mind
Sorry, but I gotta be strong and leave you behind

She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
Closed legs don't get fed
Go out there and make my bread
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She ended up in the wrong car
Bruised up, scarred hard

They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the 9
See, everyday they feel the struggle but stayin' on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line
But I know there's a drop in the block
You move slow, you gettin' pressure from cops
You don't know whether or not to lay low

Whatever, now she like sour amaretto
She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather

Now she tricks on the track right by school
She take the loss 'cause she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, or pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she ask him: ""Where my money at?""

No more time left to be here

And no longer were you with me

To be everything that I've been looking for

And I don't wanna take for granted

Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me

And you're beside me

Everything that I've been looking for

[Verse 1]
Now even though I try to play it off
I'm thinkin' 'bout you all day long
And I can't wait for shorty to come through
From your lips and back up to your eyes
My hands on your hips when we grind
I'm fantasizin' 'bout what I'm gon' do to you
Got me fiendin' for her love, can't lie
Man, you should see how she got me
Spendin' all this time with her
And I couldn't leave her if I wanted to
Her love turns men into fools
Tell me what a man is to do
[Chorus]
'Cause I can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touchin' me
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me
I'm goin' outta my mind
I can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touchin' me
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me
I'm goin' outta my mind

[Verse 2]
Whenever we up in this bed
And my fingers all in your hair
I wonder if you feel me watchin' you
'Cause I can't go a night without your lovin'
And got me lookin' at this phone
Every time it rings, I hope it's you, girl
Got me bracin' for your love
And I've fallen for you, I can't lie
I just wanna be with you
And, yes, she got me there, I said it

Flashes de luz (luz, luz)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Ela não acredita em estrelas cadentes
Mas acredita em sapatos e carros
Pisos de madeira no apartamento novo
Alta-costura dos departamentos das lojas
Você é do tipo que adora começar algo novo
Eu sou mais viagens pra Flórida
Pedimos um Hors d'oeuvres, com vista pra água
Direto da página do seu autor favorito
E o clima está tão alegre
Cara, por que nem sempre a vida é facil assim?
Ela no espelho dançando tão frágil
Recebo uma ligação, ""Onde você tá, Yeezy?""
E eu tento te convencer com uma conversa fiada
Até levar um flash do paparazzi
Merda, os caras me pegaram
Odeio esses caras mais do que nazistas
[Hook: Dwele]
Pelo que me lembro, eu sei que você ama se exibir
Mas nunca pensei que você levaria isso tão longe
O que eu sei?

O que eu sei? Sei

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Eu sei que faz um tempo, amor
Mal conversamos, eu tava fazendo meu negócio
Eu sei que foi errado, querida
Aye, querida, ultimamente você não sai da minha cabeça
E se alguém me dissesse há um mês atras
Apesar de fingir, eu não iria querer saber
Se alguém me dissesse há um ano atrás
Que ficaria tão dificil
Sentindo como o Katrina sem o FEMA
Como Martin sem Gina
Como um vôo sem visto
Primeira classe com o banco inclinado, eu ainda te vejo
No meu passado, você está do outro lado do vidro
No museu da minha memória
Só estou dizendo, hey, Mona Lisa
Volte pra casa, eu sei que você não pode passear sem um César

Now that it's all said and done
I can't believe you were the one
To build me up then tear me down
Like an old abandoned house
And what you said when you left
Just left me cold and out of breath
I fell too far, was in way too deep
Guess I let you get the best of me

[Chorus]
Well, I never saw it coming
I should've started running
A long, long time ago
And I never thought to doubt you
I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know
I'm slowly getting closure
I guess it's really over
I'm finally getting better
And now I'm picking up the pieces
And spending all of these years
Putting my heart back together
'Cause the day I thought I'd never get through
I got over you
[Verse 2]
You took a hammer to these walls
Dragged the memories down the hall
Packed your bags and walked away
There was nothing I could say
And when you slammed the front door shut
A lot of others opened up
So did my eyes so I could see
That you never were the best for me

[Chorus]
Well, I never saw it coming
I should've started running
A long, long time ago
And I never thought I'd doubt you
I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know

So many niggas from my hood on they back

It's like the bottom of the ninth and I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out quite the way I want it to be

And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me

And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand feet

Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me

If I had eyes in the back of my head
I would have told you that you looked good as I walked away
If you could have tried to trust the hand that fed
You would've never been hungry but you never really be
The more of this or less of this or is there any difference
Or are we just holding onto the things we don't have anymore

Sometimes time doesn't heal
No, not at all
Just stand still
While we fall
In or out of love, again I doubt
I'm going to win you back when you got eyes like that
It won't let me in
Always looking out

Lot of people spend their time just floating
We were victims together but lonely
You got hungry eyes that just can't look forward
Can't give them enough but we just can't start over
Building with bent nails we're falling but holding
I don't want to take up anymore of your time
Time, time, time

I turned on the evening news
Saw a old man being interviewed
Turning a hundred and two today
Asked him what's the secret to life
He looked up from his old pipe
Laughed and said ""All I can say is.""

[Chorus]
Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your better half
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink
[Verse 2]
I was glued to my TV when it looked like he looked at me and said
""Best start putting first things first.""
'Cause when your hourglass runs out of sand
You can't flip it over and start again
Take every breathe God gives you for what it's worth

[Chorus]
Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your better half
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think

So I've been tryna slow it down
I've been tryna take it in
In this here today gone tomorrow world we're livin' in

Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife

Flip flop slippers just to show off the pedicure

If you are what you say you are (Yeah, yeah)

Then have no fear, the camera's here (Uh)
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh, oh, oh, oh (The return)
If you are what you say you are

And the lights are on (Ha)
And they want a show, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah (Free Chilly)
[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, uh, a fresh, cool young Lu'
Tryna cash his microphone check, two-one-two
Wanna believe my own hype, but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees; ""What have you brung? You?
Did you improve on a design? Did you do something new?
Well, your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You—the more famous person—you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too!""
And then it hit me, standing outside of heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me: I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung blue
""Go back, whatever you did, you undo.""
Heavy as heaven, the devil on me two tons too
Ha, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha

Down through the basement, past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid and (Pew!)
Out through China, nearly misses airliners
Magnified times five, this was pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze (Woo!)
Now, that's important to say
'Cause even with all that, most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called, and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair, and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gon' clap, and they ain't gon' praise (Uh)
They want everything back (Back) that they've paid
'Cause they've been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim

So, chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away
'Cause I've been standing in this line for, like, five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along, and when I got to the front
They told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song; and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say, ""You need to go and see that!""
And everybody claps, 'cause everybody is pleased
And then, they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like, ""Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha""
""Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha, ha""

Make you wanna touch it, make you wanna taste it
Have you lusting for it, going crazy, face it

And dance in your lap 'til you ready to pop

Go ahead and let the light shine through
I know it's hard on a rainy day
You wanna shut the world out and just be left alone
But don't run out on your faith

'Cause sometimes that mountain you've been climbin' is just a grain of sand
And what you've been out there searchin' for forever is in your hands
And when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else

It's so easy to get lost inside
A problem that seems so big at the time
It's like a river that's so wide
It swallows you whole
While you're sittin' 'round thinkin' 'bout what you can't change
And worrying about all the wrong things
Time's flyin' by, movin' so fast

There's a Skoal can and a Playboy no one else would know you hid
And then I'd say I know it's tough
When you break up after seven months

But all I can say is pain like that is fast and it's rare

Stickin' out of your back and you're wonderin' if you'll survive
But you'll make it through this and you'll see
You're still around to write this letter to me

At the stop sign at Tomlinson and Eighth
Always stop completely, well, don't just tap your brakes
And when you get a date with Bridgett, make sure the tank is full
On second thought, forget it, that one turns out kinda cool
Each and every time you have a fight
Just assume you're wrong and Dad is right

And you should really thank Mrs. Brinkman, she spends so much extra time
It's like she sees the diamond underneath and she's polishin' you 'til you shine

And she left before I had the chance to say, oh-oh
Words that would mend the things that were broken
But now it's far too late, she's gone away

I may not make it through the night

The noises that she made kept me awake, oh

To find me somewhere inside of you

Broke down motor in the front yard, ha ha

And nail it up on a knotty pine tree
Saying I was here first

Drink a beer with my friends (drink a beer with my friends)

It's time to make our move, I'm shaking off the rust

Steady hands just take the wheel
And every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal for the life I lead

Switch like seasons, when the summers, spring and fall
And back seat of my jeep, I'm chrome veet and all
On the hunt for these girls were like my day to day
I get 'em alone, I jump 'em and then fade away
I give it good so some of them won't stay away
They try to lock me up, but I break away
And to the day i lay my eyes on the princess
And you can tell she was a dime from a distance
It took a minute to come to my senses
She's the perfect match and God is my witness
Now for the first time I've opened my eyes
Put the glass in the air, now I toast to the sky
Feels like I'm in heaven, and I'm hoping to fly

Hung my cotton dress on rusted wire
Up there on Pilahatchee Bridge
Just a crazy roughneck's daughter
Jumped head-first into the water
Baptized away my sins
Hitched to town with Bobby Jo and Tommy
Couple of lookers, new best friends
We slipped in the back of Sunday service
Know them church ladies, they heard us
Bum smoke money from the offering
[Chorus]
Mama said, ""Idle hands are Devil's handiwork
Oh, the trouble you'll get into
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do""
Yeah!

Sign read 'Bait, Chips, Beer and Ammunition'
That Slim-Jim bag boy hadn't a prayer
Well, I hiked my skirt and did the talkin'
While them boys were busy walkin'
Case of .5 out the back door
Hid deep in the Mississippi backwoods
We danced and played around 'til dark
Well, I had them wrestlin' for my first kiss
Turned into a fight and they missed
Me speedin' off in Tommy's car

With the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat

All that talk, but it seems like it can't come through
All them lies like you could satisfy me

If you ready to ride, I'm down for a one night stand
I'll accept it any way that I can, cause I ain't your man
I'll try for whatever it's worth
Just remember who played who first
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
I can't keep my eyes off ya
I can tell why them other guys lost ya
Your kind's rarer than a flyin' saucer
And that's why I can offer, similarities in our characters
Haven't you heard the word 'round town? How I get down
They gon' whistle, everybody part is official
And that ass wit' you, got my dick as hard as a missile
Don't hop on top, cause I ride around with a pistol
If they pull us over, I'll be out of town with an issue
If you was mine, I'd introduce you to mama girl
You're stylin' in your boots and Gabbana, I'm so used to your Prada
I take trips cause out in Houston it's hotter
Throw in that Al Green and juice the Impala
Make my jewels and my collar
You had me feelin' like a fool when I hollered
Tryin' to squeeze in but you wouldn't bothered
Now I ain't neither, soon as I realized that I ain't need her

A yo, the crib got your friends working
We travel to France for french curtains, you was there when I was on the bench hurtin’
Now that I own my team, it’s only right that I condone my queen
Try to show her my dream
And I can’t let her get lost now, she carries the money
The hammer and material across town
And understand she fine, understand she mine
She understand the grind, cooks, clean, and irons
And whatever she wanna push I’mma cosign
And if I ain’t got it already than I’mma go find it
I guess I’mma lucky don, and she’s a lucky queen
Cause her jewelry box look likes Lucky Charms
All color stones and she know that I’m in the hood
But she also knows that I’m coming home
Mr. Raspy, thought I was in love with money

I will play a song for you and you will let me know exactly
How the ladies will respond from a women’s point of view
And that’s why my girl is with me
I love it when she layin’ in the bed with a Pearl Long Vickie
The next best thing to a soldier
Go hard with a fat ass and a head full of rollers
Just look in her eyes and tell she’s real
Just imagine the way she smell and the way she feel

And you know I’m from the streets so its crazy ill

Who you know fresher than Hov? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back, yeah, hearin' me rap
Is like hearin' G. Rap in his prime, I'm
Young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep!
Grand openin', grand closin'
Goddamn, your man Hov cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him?
With no pen, just draw off inspira-tion-tion
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him-him
With cheap imitations for these generations

From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (Yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 45, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (One thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore (Come on)

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take!
[Chorus 2: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb

Heard the nightlife lost life without me
Both the feds and the state wanna see bout me
The whole city got biz-zerk, he got three
That other nigga got a hit, but shawty, he not me (Naw)
Who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed
The King back now, hoes don't even know how to act now
Hit the club, strippers getting naked 'fore I sat down
Still balling, money stack taller than Shaq now
Still push a button to let the roof on the 'Lac down

And if I catch another case I know I'll truly be missed, so I'ma—
Keep a cool head, stay out of the news
And show these other rappers it's bedtime (Bedtime)
It's clear to see that I'm ahead of my time

Let East Coast bang, let West Coast bang
And Rule gon' bring the ghetto gospel (Ooh!)
To every hood possible, pushing through in the sky blue
Back with the Gods, you now, preferably the four pound
Slugs flying at the speed of sound
Tryna catch the ears of niggas that's running they mouths
I might get my Brooklyn niggas to run in your house
I don't really understand what the running's about
But we hunters, we take pride in airing our prey out
Leaving 'em laid out dead in just a sport
'Cause we ain't playing up here in New York

It's guaranteed you gon' die, you might get missed

But when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online
Wise has awoken, and you know they say that you deserved it
Whenever you die with your eyes open
I still hold the title
'Cause I'm in the hood like them little motorcycles
Stick up kids hoppin' out with them old rifles
Just doing shit for nothin', it's so spiteful, ha, I'm just like you
Word that niggas wanna murk you is in the air
A double shot of 'gnac and the purple is in the air
And I'm not cocky, I'm confident
So when you tell me I'm the best it's a compliment

Driving down the interstate
Running thirty minutes late
Singing Margaritaville and minding my own
Some foreign car driving dude with the road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone
He started yelling at me like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird and then he was gone

Some beach, somewhere
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growing and a warm breezes a blowing
I picture myself right there
On some beach, somewhere
[Verse 2]
I circled the parking lot trying to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar was getting into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up
But from out of nowhere a Mercedes Benz
Came cruising up and whipped right in

[Chorus 2]
Some beach, somewhere
There's nowhere to go when you got all day to get there
There's cold margaritas and hot señioritas smiling with long dark hair
On some beach, somewhere

I sat in that waiting room
It seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said doc's ready for you
You’re not going to feel a thing we'll give you some Novocain
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two
But he stuck that needle down deep in my gum
And he started drilling before I was numb

I woke up early this morning with a pounding in my head
I'd been out the night before with all my friends
A little worried, kinda wondering what i did
I said lord please forgive me for my sins
My wife wanted to kill me but she tried to save me first
You're going if i have to drag your butt to church

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life
[Verse 2]
I read the hymns and kinda sorta sang along
Made it throught the sunday sermon wide awake
We met the family for dinner at our home
Drank some beers, watched the game and cooked some steaks
My little brother had a big fight with his wife
My poor mother sat between them both all night

[Hook]
I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life

[Verse 3]
We said a prayer for Cousin Michael in Iraq
We're all aware he may never make it back
We talked about the way we missed his stupid jokes
And how he wanted to be a soldier more than most

[Verse 4]
I laid in bed that night and thought about the day
And how my life was like a rollercoaster ride
The ups and downs and crazy turns along the way
It'll throw you off if you don't hold on tight
You can't really smile until you've shed some tears

Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright, stop, pajama time
[Verse 1]
Come here, little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean ""rap"" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything but little boys
And that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot-poot, it's okay
Oops, my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

Between the champagne and the sound of whispers in my ear

And build us a little campfire

Got a hug and a kiss and ""that's too bad""
She said, ""I can go to work until you find another job""
I thought, I like the sound of that
Watch TV and take long naps
Go from a hard working dad to being Mr. Mom
[Chorus]
Well
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the fifteenth time
Breakfast six, naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long
And it's only Monday Mr. Mom

[Verse 2]
Football, soccer, and ballet
Squeeze in Scouts and PTA
And there's that shopping list she left that's seven pages long
How much smoke can one stove make?
The kids won't eat my charcoal cake
It's more than any man can take
Being Mr. Mom

[Chorus]
Well
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the sixteenth time
Breakfast six, naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long

You left your Bible on the dresser
So I put it in the drawer
'Cause I can't seem to talk to God
Without yelling anymore
And when I sit at your piano
I can almost hear those hymns
The keys are just collecting dust
But I can't close the lid

[Chorus]
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith
And now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper
""Things are only getting worse""
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
[Verse 2]
The preacher came by Sunday
Said he missed me at the service
He told me Jesus loves me
But I'm not sure I deserve it
'Cause the faithful man that you loved
Is nowhere to be found
Since they took all that he believed
And laid it in the ground

[Chorus]
And left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith
And now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper
""Things are only getting worse""
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church

[Bridge]
I still believe in Heaven
And I'm sure you've made it there
But as for me without your love, girl

Debbie just hit the wall, she never had it all
One Prozac a day, husband's a CPA
Her dreams went out the door when she turned twenty-four
Only been with one man, what happened to her plan?
She was gonna be an actress, she was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake her ass on the hood of Whitesnake's car
Her yellow SUV is now the enemy
Looks at her average life, and nothing has been alright

[Chorus]
Since Bruce Springsteen, Madonna, way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie, and music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school, they tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied with 19, 19, 1985, 1985
[Verse 2]
She's seen all the classics, she knows every line
Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, even Saint Elmo's Fire
She rocked out to Wham, not a big Limp Bizkit fan
Thought she'd get a hand on a member of Duran Duran
Where's the mini-skirt made of snake skin?
And who's the other guy that's singing in Van Halen?
When did reality become TV?
Whatever happened to sitcoms, game shows? (on the radio?)

On the radio was Springsteen, Madonna, way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie, and music still on MTV

She hates time, make it stop
When did Mötley Crüe become classic rock? (Classic rock)
And when did Ozzy become an actor?

'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's witchu in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie—Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
We have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream
[Chorus 1]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Momma's gon' be alright

[Verse 2]
Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job but his job
Was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom and at the time
Every house that we lived in either kept gettin'
Broken into and robbed or shot up on the block and your Mom
Was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurts so bad it broke your Momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre  and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh! Momma's only gone for the moment

We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, momma's gon' be alright
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world, I'ma buy a diamond ring for you
I'ma sing for you, I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck

I remember when I met you on Crenshaw
I almost crashed my truck, and spilled my Hen' dawg
Yes you, God blessed you, I was trying to get next to you
Your homegirls was hating, but I didn't care
You said you had a man, I was like ""where?""
It was something so different about you
I felt so gifted around you
Even though you had a man and all
I took the chance to call, we held hands at the mall
That day was so special to me
Your man left you at Mickey D's
You called me, I scooped you up
I seen fear in your eyes, the tears in your eyes
He can't hug you like I hug you
Better yet love you like this thug do
[Hook - Mario Winans]
It's official, you're the one
But you're already taken
Oh I can't help the way I'm feeling
You're the one, I wish I could replace him
Cause I know that baby you're the one

[Verse - Guerilla Black]
I'm having the time of my life
Felt the world on wheels, you and your homegirl got some skills
Nobody make me feel like you do
Or better yet real like you, I messed around and killed dude
I seen home-girly just flossin, we made eye contact
Dude always is flossin, me never
You and B-l-a-c-k forever, tattered on my neck in green letters
Late night eating Haagen-Dazs, watching Uncut
And me sitting there, playing wit your butt
Took off your clothes, I hit it on the counch
Even though mom's in the house
Nothing could replace this feeling
It's like winning 2 million, our bond closer than Cicilians
I know old boy won't leave you alone
I know you love him, but our love is strong

Bullets bustin' constantly, ravaging yo city streets
Broken bones lay alone, scattered across the concrete

I watched the sunrise and it made me think of you
The way you talk to the flowers and make them grow
And in the middle of all these flowers
There's one single stem red rose
It stood out from the rest, the fairest of them all
It made me think of what you asked me
Can you call a rose by any other name?

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
See, it ain't easy bein' me, life as a celebrity is less than heavenly
I got these fakes and these backstabbers chasin' me around
And it's always drama, whenever I wanna get around
Mama told me, long before I ever came up
Gotta be true to what you do and keep the game up
‘Cause things change and jealousy becomes a factor
Best friends at your wife's house, tryin' to mack her
I'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin' at my door
And I got no time to worry, I'm steady wantin' more
Every day is a test, yes, I try hard
But I'm strugglin' with every breath, I pray to God
That the woman that I left at home, all alone
There ain't nothing like tryin' to bone, over the phone
In my mind, I can see her naked, I can't take it
Got me shakin' at the thought that we can make it
I thought you knew
[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I'm rollin' out on tour today
You gettin' sad, ‘cause I'm going away (Nah-ah-ah)
The chickenheads wanna play with me
You gettin' mad, ‘cause you think I'ma sway
Some of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck
I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage (Nah-ah-ah)
Still I be gettin' lonely for you
I'm comin' home soon as I make this pay, make this pay

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I call you up long distance, on the telephone
Wanna tuck you in, even though I can't make it home
I whisper things in your ear like you're near me
Wonder if you feel me from far away, and can you hear me?
It seems to me, that you're jealous
‘Cause I'm hustlin' and makin' money with the fellas
In the backstreets, tryin' to track me, baby, hold up
Thugs get lonely too, but I'm a soldier
And there's no way I'ma stop makin' money
‘Cause your attitude's changed and you're actin' a little funny
Always complainin', saying we don't spend time
Can't you see I got enough stress on my mind?
And hangin' up like you all that?

Take your picture out my back pocket, man, it's on

Wanna love you 'til the sun rise, buckwild
Touchin' every wall in the house, thug style
Put your hands on the headboard, think of me
Drippin' sweat on top of you, sink and see
It's in your head that I'm making love, so turn the lights down
Reminisce and relax ‘cause, baby, right now
I feel it in the middle of my stomach
You whisper in my ear and, baby, tell me how you really want it
Hold on tightly, watch the ceilin'
Scratch my back's how you react, let me know you feel me
‘Cause everything I'm giving to you, is so true
And thugs get lonely too (You know)

Hardwood floors in that bitch that connect
From the front to the back, nigga top that

Push that button, microwave oven

""Is that a fish tank, burrowed, in the middle of the dash?""
Yeah pimpin' don't put your fingers on my glass
Got a two lane bowling alley up in the truck
And on the other side a bed if she wantin' to fuck
Clap off lights when you gettin' affection
Clap on lights when you find the protection

Details don't matter, we both paid the price
Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes it'd be like that, baby

Now every time I see you, I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby, I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it

So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

But we both know nothing comes close to

I might be grilled out nicely (Oh) in my white tee (Oh)
Or on South Beach (Oh) in my wife beat'
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see, my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it

And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I

[Chorus]
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
(Goodbye)

[Verse 2]
Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

[Bridge]
I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change
[Chorus]
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Kanye West Featuring Jamie Foxx,,False,6,1,7,Gold Digger,23,2005-12-31,"Bone Digger Lyrics== Bone Digger ==

Parody of ""Gold Digger"" by Kanye West (Featuring Jamie Foxx)
(Romans 1:18-25, Job 40:15-41:34)

They make a monkey right out of me -- Yes, they've been tryin' endlessly
Overeager bonediggers -- they never found that jigsaw piece
They make a monkey right out of me -- It makes for funky biology
I'm not the kid of some hominid, who comes from a lizard, whose mama was a fish
Now I ain't hatin' on the bone diggers, but I say evolution don't figure
Now, I ain't hatin' on the bone diggers, but I ain't never seen no holes bigger
It sounds like no evidence found, it sounds like their heads in the ground
It sounds like they're just too proud, it sounds quite boneheaded
You need to ponder whether evolution is wrong
Whether maybe you was put on under cover of dawn
They said, ""We can tell from rocks, we tell by the carbon""
'Cause this world has gotta flock of descendants of Charles Robert Darwin
But I'm lookin' for the odds at casinos
That life could come to be from random acids amino
Zero -- we know it's hocus pocus
And they wanna make all of that an accidental process?
O.K., let's pretend a fishy got some kids
That stood up on their fins and crawled up on land
Without evidence and here we are today
If you're trustin' in this worldview you better have faith
You know why? They make too much of nothin'
Stuff that I've heard it should have been on Mythbusters
Their best forensic samples couldn't cut the mustard
You don't care what none of us say you still trust it
(They make a monkey) Now I ain't hatin' on the bone diggers (right out of me)
But I say evolution don't figure (It makes for funky)
Now, I ain't hatin' on the bone diggers (biology)
But I ain't never seen no holes bigger (I'm not the kid)
It sounds like no evidence found (of some hominid)
It sounds like their heads in the ground (who comes from a lizard)
It sounds like they're just too proud (whose mama was a fish)
It sounds quite boneheaded
1859's the fateful year -- they've had 150 years to prove their great new theory
I know some funny ways they found support for some of it, kids
They made some hominids from parts of gibbons and pigs
Your museums are deceiving when you visit one they
Take a couple bones pawn it off as a primate
They were s'posed to find all sorts of life forms we could study
They went to the rocks and got dinosaurs in the muddy
They're talkin' down actin' like the Bible is so funny
Could've got dinos sooner if they tried Job 41-y
If it ain't no bunk, holler ""We want proof now, we want proof now, yeah!""
It's somethin' that'll make you mad
Cause all the links they had were either weak or bad
Great big digs since the 1860's
And after waiting and searchin' they found out it doesn't exist?
CHORUS
Now I ain't hating on the bone digger, no, not me
I've found trilobites in stone and some petrified trees
You know evolution ain't paleontology
Transition forms are lackin' -- got a hole up his sleeve
But -- the other option's not fun
So he gonna make you into a man out of that pond scum
This is his religion baby, don't be surprised
That fishy on all fours on his jeep's his messiah
So, let's no fight -- I won't abuse Darwin 'cause that's not nice
And they're gonna keep stallin' and tryin' to prove they're right though
And when you catch on we'll lead you back to the Bible
SECOND HALF OF CHORUS
Romans 1:18-20
The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse

Ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid
[Verse 2]
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you

[Bridge]
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
(I watched you die, in your sleep)
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
(I was too young for you to lean on me)
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain

Can I talk to you for a minute?
You know, I be thinking to myself
We had a lot of good times together (Come on, baby, come on darlin', darlin')
We did everything together
Yeah, we would wake up early in the morning (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
And just get in the car and just ride on out (Just one chance)
Remember that? (All I need, all I need, is just one wish)
Use to watch the sunrise
(One wish, one wish)
Use to watch the sunset (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
We was everything to each other, you know? (Just one chance)
(All I need, all I need, is just one wish)
Damn, I miss those days
(One wish, one wish, one wish)
(All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
If I could, if I could just hold you in my arms, you know what I mean? (All I need, all I need, is just one wish, one wish)
It just feels so good
(One wish)
One little, itty, bitty wish
If I could just have one wish
Damn baby..
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you ...

[Verse 1]
As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
'Cause, we couldn't be alone
See your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt
Back then we were in school and that's your favorite excuse
Growin' up I was a fool and I can't lie, I'm missing you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list

[Pre-Chorus]
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes
'Cause I'll be okay if I get one

[Chorus]
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me, I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life

If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
So girl, don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe

Tone in my lap and you know it's a pump
Breaking down the good green, rolling the blunt
Ghetto pimp type, girls say I'm the mayne
Ice on the wrist with the ice in the chain
Riding through the hood, got me gripping the grain
And I'm sipping the same while I'm changing the lane
Eyes real tight cause I'm choking the green
Vision messed up cause I'm drinking the lean
Messing with a D-boy, riding them big toys
Make your main gal wanna get on my team
She gotta give it up before she get in my car
I ain't Denzel but I know I'm a star
Cause when I'm in the club, I be back in the fog
In the V.I.P. part and be buying the bar

Eminem,,False,8,8,16,When I'm Gone,6,2005-12-31,"When I’m Gone Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, it's my life
In my own words, I guess

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby, ha
[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
[Verse 2]
I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it wit' ya!""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause, man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late.""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'

So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 3]
Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow and ""Thank you all for comin' out""
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
""But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?""
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'.""
""But baby, wait!"" – ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, keep it real.""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say
[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing

Can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?

The things we seen on the screen is not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars

On a snow-white Christmas Eve
Goin' home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was goin' way too fast
Before she knew it
She was spinnin' on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own

So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on

It was still gettin' colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleepin' like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way

So from now on tonight""

Give me that million-dollar beat and let me show you what to do with it
Who that is? That's the illest rapper chopped and screwed on it
Couldn't snatch the game that's what they told me so I'm provin' it
Put the truth in Texas with Scott Storch and you got you a hit
Hit and never miss, rep your click and throw 'em high
Because Chamillionaire's the answer to the game like Allen I
Middle fingers to the sky if they don't like that reply
Cause any DJ that deny is a motherfucking liar
So give the ladies what that want, got 'em racing to the front
Of the stage to feel the bass and tell the DJ turn it up (turn it up)
Yeah, Sound of Revenge, send Universal to get my plaques
Rap is dead so I'ma bring it back like DJ's do when they hear my tracks
Check out my track record, they'll say I'ma track wrecker
Hotter than a black pepper now that I am back nigga (he's back!)

Multi-colored diamonds got us shining, they say our jewellery sick
Houston got a problem and you don't want nothing to do with it
Do you kid? I ain't think, I'm tipping slow
When my trunk is lifting up look at the neons as they glow
Groupies never giving up, they be everywhere I go
When that elevator go up to my suite they there fo' sho'
Told me that she didn't care about my money, wasn't hearing it
Looks can be deceiving as Chamillion paint appearances
You know how we do it at home of Screw and purple syrup is
She got turned out quicker than my power steering did

Now I was born in the belly on the bottom of the map
Where the wet paint drip jelly on Pirellis
And the chrome on the Chevys when I'm choppin' in the trap
Country as hell, they some warriors
Tote somethin' that spray same shape as Florida
Lookin' for me boy, you'll find me
Down in Dougherty County in a small city
Called Albany, Georgia (Georgia!)
Where they used to call us some bamas
And now they jockin the grammar
Watch your mouth 'less you out for some manner
But ya hustlers wasn't on every corner
Like the Waffle House in Atlanta
R.I.P Camoflauge out in Savannah (Georgia!)
Now you might come for vacation, leave on probation
Home of the strip club, known for the thick girls
Where the tricks put tips in the tip cup
For the thick chick in the thong with the big butt
Wanna get love? Won't be cheap, long money like Peachtree
Man, she take it off like Freaknik down here in (Georgia!)
When you see them confederate flags, you know what is
Yo' folks picked cotton here, that's why we call it the field
I got a Chevrolet on twenty-sixes
I'm from GA, GA! (Georgia!)

Hang where bad bitches are, kill babies and empty clips

So shallow, my minds hollow, my styles borrowed, need help
What'd you expect, I disrespect, myself
And this ho, her deep sorrow, I deep burrow, pussy help
Now my lifes real bad
I never though this would be the life I had
My parents mad, can't talk to my dad,I need mother who is MADD
Why the fuck is getting fucked up a fucking fad, real fucking sad
Probably contracted a diseases
Now I'm shitting out my nose every time I sneeze
Somebody save me please
Please stop me, take my keys

Am I strong like David Dunn

I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I shoulda held on tight, I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you, guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt

Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side

I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit

Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:

And when I bust yo' ass, I'm gon' continue to rock

She poured her heart and soul into their three-bedroom ranch
Spent her days raisin' babies, ironing his pants
Came home one day from the grocery store and found his note
And without him there to stop her, she let herself go

Let herself go on her first blind date
Had the time of her life with some friends at the lake
Let herself go buy a brand new car
Drove it down to the beach he always said was too far
Sand sure felt good between her toes

I'm gonna land beside a lion
And run my fingers through his mane
Or I might find out what it's like
To ride a drop o' rain

Don't cry for me down here
I'm gonna walk with my Grandaddy

And I'll tell him how I've missed him
Every minute since he left
And then I'll hug his neck

All these questions I can't answer
And so much work to do

And I see my Maker's face
I'll stand forever in the light
Of His amazing grace

Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Griffin, she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryna wait
Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, ""You know what you do to me""
She starts off, ""Well I don't usually""
Then I whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South (Ooow)

By a Cherokee and a green drop-top

Clever with the bars, call me nifty
Racking up the hits, get shwifty

Nothing like the taste of sweet decline

[Verse 1]
I was down, and I fell, I fell so fast
Dropping like the grains in an hourglass
Never say forever 'cause nothing lasts
Dancing with the bones of my buried past
[Pre-Chorus]
Never mind, there's nothing I could do
Bet your life there's something killing you

[Chorus]
It's a shame we have to die my dear
No one's getting out of here alive
This time
What a way to go, but have no fear
No one's getting out of here alive
This time

[Verse 2]
I'm finished, I'm getting you off my chest
Made you come clean in a dirty dress
A promise is a promise you kept in check
Hard to cross a heart that beats this fast

[Verse 3]
Take a good hard look for the very last time
The very last one in a very long line
Only took a second to say goodbye
Been a pleasure, but the pleasure's been mine all mine

There were times I thought I'd never see the break of day
It was hard for me to see your plan for me
And I tried to believe surely it won't last always
But night after night

Then late one night, then late one night
I read in your love letter that it's gonna get better

Alone in this house again tonight
I got the TV on, the sound turned down and a bottle of wine
There's pictures of you and I on the walls around me
The way that it was and could have been surrounds me
I'll never get over you walking away

[Chorus]
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry
[Verse 2]
Would it help if I turned a sad song on
""All By Myself"" would sure hit me hard now that you're gone
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters
It's going to hurt bad before it gets better
But I'll never get over you by hiding this way

[Chorus]
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control

I would not trade them for gold
Because they laugh and they cry me
Somehow sanctify me
They are woven in the stories I have told

For the years that have passed
Since the last time you and I
Dusted off those memories
But the running and the races

There is always somewhere else I had to be
Time gets slim, my old friend

Throw your dollar bills and leave your thrills all here with me
And speak, but don't pretend I won't defend you anymore, you see
It aches in every bone
I'll die alone, but not for you
My eyes don't need to see that ugly thing
I know it's me, you fear
If you want me, hold me back

Frail, the skin is dry and pale
The pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy

Just leave 'em where they lie
And tell yourself you'll be the death of me

I don't need a friend, I need to mend so far away
So come, sit by the fire and play a while

It's been eroded by the weather here

Old man Wrigley lived in that white house
Down the street where I grew up
Mama used to send me over with things
We struck a friendship up
I spent a few long summers
Out on his old porch swing

[Verse 2]
Said he was in the war when in the navy
Lost his wife, lost his baby
Broke down and asked him one time
""How you keep from goin' crazy""
He said, ""I'll see my wife and son in just a little while""
I asked him what he meant, he looked at me and smiled
[Chorus]
Said, ""I raise my hands
Bow my head
I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life
Than just what I can see, oh, I believe""

[Verse 3]
A few years later I was off at college
Talkin' to mom on the phone one night
Gettin' all caught up on the gossip
The ins and outs of the small town life
She said, ""Oh, by the way son
Old man Wrigley has died""

[Verse 4]
Later on that night
I laid there thinkin' back
Thought about a couple long-lost summers
I didn't know whether to cry or laugh
If there was ever anybody
Deserved a ticket to the other side
It'd be that sweet old man
Who looked me in the eye

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft-spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right if
I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing
[Pre-Chorus]
She fuck with small-town niggas, I got bigger dreams (Bigger dream)

Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'til 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla 'cause you know they 'bout to cut the lights on

[Verse 2]
And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar
I'm wondering 'bout you, like where you from and who you are
'Cause you a star, no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type that light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out to zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine, huh

[Verse 1]
Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' ""dollar and a dream"" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?

Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean

And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, ""Make it quick if the Lord take me""
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, ""sell dope, rap or go to NBA""
In that order, it's that sort of thinkin'
That been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain, listen...108Embed"

I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,  sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
'pologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream
As I write this, the team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' ""You do you and I do me""
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—

Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn

She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made

And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Starving, you know, covergirls eat nothing
She says, ""Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything, what's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife
[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
[Bridge: J. Cole]
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)

[Outro: J. Cole]
(I swear to God, bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas, yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from—112Embed"

[Interlude]
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry
And I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die (Don't wanna die no more)
'Cause now you're here and I just wanna be
Right by your side
On any night that you be crying, baby
I'll dry your eyes
I'll dry your eyes
[Verse]
Every time you go to sleep you look like you in Heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's
You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend
Yeah, I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Well how 'bout that?

[Outro]
She gets him (you get me)
She hugs him (you kiss me)
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
She gets him (you get me)

And I believe you, I believe you

Feeling used, but I'm
Still missing you and I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
And now all this time is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her
[Verse 2: gnash]
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text, but then I never mind that shit
I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
If you wanted me, you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put

Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me?

AZ, Kool G Rap &  Tre Williams ""The Battlefield""""The Battlefield"" is an amazing portrayal of hip-hop's recent evolution. The genre is starting to age, and so are its key musicians. Mafioso rap veterans Ghostface, AZ and Kool G take their adulthood experiences and apply them to the metaphorical battlefield. Never forget - there's a war going on outside.99.

SZA ""West Savannah""95. Vic Mensa	""Feel That""Following his breakout mixtape Innanetape and four appearances on last year’s top 100 song list, Vic Mensa is back with his Smoko Ono produced banger ""Feel That"". The song breaks away from Vic’s reputation as a “lyrical” rapper, substituting lyrical complexity for a strong flow and crazy energy. Vic’s about to take over the game and we feel that!94. Mick Jenkins	ft Joey Bada$$ ""Jerome""93. Tinashe ft Schoolboy Q ""2 On""92. Jay Electronica ft. LaTonya Givens ""Better In Tune With The Infinite""91. Big K.R.I.T. ""King Of The South""90. PRyhme ""Courtesy"" In classic Premo style, the production is lead by organs and 90's scratched vocal samples. Royce blesses us with two thrilling verses - snarky shots at his competition, sprinkled pop culture references, and packed wordplay. Rapping well is the only way he knows how, and it proves true on this record.89. Childish Gambino ""Sober""88. NehruvianDOOM ""OM""87. Drake	""How About Now""86. Statik Selektah ft Action Bronson, Royce da 5'9 & Black Thought ""The Imperial""85. O.T Genasis	""CoCo""BAKIN' SODA, I GOT BAKIN' SODA!O.T took the internet by storm with this cocaine ballad. His hilariously serious tone combined with references to Nemo and Nino Brown made us all fall in love with the coco, even Nicki Minaj. The biggest fans of this song are O.T's peers - y'all saw what happened to Busta Rhymes, right?84. Vince Staples ft James Fauntleroy ""Nate""83. Lupe Fiasco ft Ty Dolla $ign ""Deliver""82. Theophilus London ft Kanye West ""Can't Stop""81. Future ft. Andre 3000 ""Benz Friends (Whatchutola)""80. Jay Electronica ft. Jay Z ""We Made It Freestyle"" Jay Electricity and Hova joined forces at the top of the  year to murder Drake & Soulja Boy’s 2013 New Year anthem “We Made It”. The chemistry is undeniable as the two flow effortlessly over the blaring horns. While both dropped serious knowledge on The Five Percent Nation of Islam, every line packs a punch. Exhibit A? Jigga hitting Drizzy square in the jaw with this right hook: “Sorry Mrs. Drizzy for so much art talk/Silly me rappin' 'bout shit that I really bought”79. Beyonce ft. Nicki Minaj ""***Flawless Remix""78. ScHoolboy Q ""Prescription/Oxymoron""77. Travis Scott ft Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug ""Mamacita""76. YG ft. Jay Rock & ScHoolboy Q ""I Just Wanna Party""75. Dej Loaf	""Try Me""From the moment the muted twinkles of DDS’ “Try Me” beat creeps in, Dej commands the year’s most threatening anthem without ever raising her voice past a Cam’ronian monotone. It runs like a checklist of guaranteed hip-hop success. Hook? Infectious. Flow? Unique, yet copyable by the lay listener. Lyrics? Quotable. But what exalts this song to its heights is Dej Loaf’s undeniable, next-level swagger, one that makes her one rapper you really might not want to try.74. Young Thug ft. A$AP Ferg & Freddie Gibbs ""Old English""73. Lil Wayne ft. The LOX ""Gotti""72. Mick Jenkins ""The Waters""71. Game ""Bigger Than Me""70. Childish Gambino ""Candler Road""Bino pays homage to a road in his hometown in Decatur, Atlanta, a fitting name for an instrumental that contains an interpolation of his because the internet song “Telegraph Ave.” The improvised scat hook puts a cherry on top of the seemingly effortless track that stands out as his best rap song of the year.69. Wu-Tang Clan ""Ruckus In B Minor""68. Kendrick Lamar ""Untitled""67. OG Maco ""U Guessed It""66. Drake ""Draft Day""65. Donnie Trumpet ft. Chance The Rapper & Jamila Woods	""Sunday Candy""The Social Experiment, a.k.a the Chicago “symphony”, switches things up to make a truly heartwarming track. Whether it’s the soul-filled vocals from Jamila Woods & Co, or Chance the Rapper’s two verses, nostalgia oozes out of every corner of this joint. With live instrumentation and composition by SoX, this release sets expectations high for their album SURF.64. ScHoolboy Q ""Hoover Street""63. Common ft. Vince Staples ""Kingdom""62. Jay Rock ""Parental Advisory""61. Freddie Gibbs ""Shitsville""60. Action Bronson ""Easy Rider""The psych-rock sampling accompanies Bronsolino's timeless flow like a hot dog at the ball game. Gems like “I had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans. Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin” are classic Bam Bam. ""Easy Rider"" is Mr. Wonderful's acid trip on steroids.59. Eminem	""Shady XV""58. Nicki Minaj ""Anaconda""57. J.Cole ""January 28th""56. Run The Jewels ft. boots ""Early""55. Mac Miller ""Diablo""Mac hit us with “Diablo”  on his Soundcloud account out of nowhere in February. The chilling piano line and Mac's delivery perfectly complement lyrics like “Contemplating suicide like it’s a DVD / Lost inside my mind, it’s a prison homie leave me be”. The druggy philosopher we all fell in love with is back, and trippier than ever. 54. Freddie Gibbs ""Harold's""53. Slaughterhouse ""Y'all Ready Know""52. Logic ""Nikki""51. Yelawolf ""Till It's Gone""50. Pharoahe Monch ft. Black Thought ""Rapid Eye Movement""From the moment the first bar is spat, you know Pharoahe and Tariq aren't strangers to the rap game. ""My think tank's like a piranha tank think, multiple bites figure / Mega, reality, tera, giga"" starts us off with a bang. ""Rapid Eye Movement"" sounds like it belongs in a James Bond movie49. PartyNextDoor ft. Drake ""Recognize""48. Vic Mensa ""Down On My Luck""47. PRyhme	""PRyhme""46. Vince Staples ""Blue Suede""45. Rae Sremmurd	""No Flex Zone""Serving as Rae Sremmurd's debut single, this anthem quickly blew up the charts, clubs and streets to make the oddly named duo the biggest thing in hip hop. In fact, this track was so big that the remix featured two of the hottest rappers in recent times: Nicki Minaj and Pusha T44. Nicki Minaj ft. Chris Brown, Drake & Lil Wayne ""Only"" 43. Joey Bada$$	""Big Dusty""42. Run The Jewels ""Blockbuster Night Pt. 1""41. Big K.R.I.T.	""Cadillactica""40. Pusha T ""Lunch Money""What started as an accidental release turned out to be one of the best joints of the year. The G.O.D laid down the Contra style soundtrack, while King Push’s flow was flawless. The drug dealer dichotomy did it again with lines like “What's the price of success? Lost my bitch, bought a chef”. This initial offering has us fiending for King Push, and unlike 2013’s MNIMN, he won’t need a pitch either - the shit sells itself.39. YG ft. Drake ""Who Do You Love""38. Freddie Gibbs ""Deeper""37. Mac Miller ft. Da$h & Earl Sweatshirt ""New Faces V2""36. Rae Sremmurd ""No Type""35. Isaiah Rashad ""Heavenly Father""Here Isaiah Rashad delivers dark content over a soulful instrumental, creating a nice contrast between the two. A combination of Rashad's smooth, low-tempo flow, and a melodic hook from SZA, makes this for a heavenly performance. One of the best cuts from Cilvia Demo.34. Wiz Khalifa ""We Dem Boyz""33. J.Cole ""No Role Modelz""32. Future ft. Casino, Pharrell Williams & Pusha T ""Move That Dope""31. Logic ""Soul Food""30. Eminem ft. Big Sean, Danny Brown, Dej Loaf, Royce Da 5'9 & Trick Trick ""Detroit Vs Everybody"" Detroit up-and-comers Big Sean and Danny Brown come hard enough to successfully bridge the gap between Royce and Em’s bookend verses. Between another show-stealing verse from Royce, a solid hook from Dej Loaf, and an outro from the director of the “No Fly Zone” Trick Trick, this track should keep rival MCs wary of Detroit static for time to come.29. Jay Rock ft. Chantal Kreviazuk & Kendrick Lamar ""Pay For It""28. Nas ""The Season""27. Bad Meets Evil ""Vegas""26. Logic ""Gang Related""25. Freddie Gibbs ft. Danny Brown ""High""Gangster Gibbs brings Danny on a marijuana-filled trip, backed with smooth and bass-banging production courtesy of Madlib. Getting high is what they do best, and it's no surprise hearing how well both of them sound on this joint. As expected, Danny's excited and high-registered verse flows perfectly with the beat as Freddie refuses to extinguish the fire.24. T.I ft. Young Thug ""About The Money""23. Drake ""6 God""22. Eminem ft. Sia ""Guts Over Fear""21. Run The Jewels ft. Zack de la Rocha  ""Close Your Eyes (And Count To Fuck)""20. Mick Jenkins ""Jazz"" Mick rides the beat using his notorious voice conviction skills, and as the beat mellows, his voice mellows; as the beat gets more chaotic, his voice rises. The lyrics, flow, and overall vibe of the song hits your soul and makes a new home. Mick wants us to ignore the lies and corruption in the world - and we already know that this black man ain’t talkin’ all that Jazz.19. Young Jeezy ft. Jay Z ""Seen It All""Two of hip hop's most renowned hustlers join forces yet again and the result is nothing short of astonishing. The track is a clear highlight on Jeezy's album and one of Jay's finest verses in recent memory. They are both in top form as they vividly depict the experiences of their past drug dealings. You can clearly tell there's a genuine chemistry between the two. Even if you say this song blows - that's still a compliment. It was so real Jay was brought to tears while writing his verse.18. Rick Ross ft. Big Sean & Kanye West ""Sanctified""Ross gruntFeaturing Big Sean and Kanye West in addition to production by DJ Mustard and West, ""Sanctified"" was easily the most anticipated track from Rozay's 6th album, Mastermind. While Kanye's verse was a PSA to the critics who continually attempt to tarnish his reputation, Ross rapped about grilled cheese and his Rolls Royce Wraith.

Not only did ""Sanctified"" appear #1 on our Top 10 Beats of 2014 list, but it served as the background music for the greatest viral video of all time17. ILOVEMAKONNEN ft. Drake ""Tuesday (Remix)""I Love Makonnen began 2014 as a relatively unknown artist struggling to gain relevance as a musician, and trying to break free from his manslaughter charges. Then one day...Drizzy decided to drop a verse onto “Tuesday” and nothing was the same. Makonnen sings about his drug dealing past, and his busy schedule forcing him to bend the rules of when clubs can go up. Thanks to this single, clubs will never be the same on a Tuesday.16. J.Cole 	""Wet Dreamz""Over a classic sample, Cole gives us his vintage story telling as he reminisces about his first time with a girl. He holds a cool attitude as tells the girl he's a pro - even though he's never had sex before. As thing escalate further, he watches porn videos for pointers and practices putting on a condom before the plot takes a twist right at the end. What's scary is how well this song relates. We guarantee almost every male listener felt some type of way. 15. Lil Wayne ft. Drake ""Believe Me"" The release of ""Believe Me""  raised Tha Carter V's hype up few notches thanks to the perfect combination of YMCMB's finest. Drake lays down the hook and two stylistically different verses; one that bounces perfectly with the Boi-1da-produced beat, and another with a gritty flow. Wayne matches Drake verse-for-verse and ends the track in memorable fashion

One of the more underrated aspects of ""Believe Me""  is its versatility. You can bump it while you’re browsing Genius, driving to work or school, or grinding through a workout. It appeals to all ears, just as we hope the entire album will.14. ScHoolboy Q ""Break tHe Bank""Complete with a chilling piano line and a Mario Kart 64 sample from The Alchemist, the instrumental is perfect for a modern gangster rapper like ScHoolboy Q. Throughout the track he viciously reminds the listener that it's his time and that he ain't no one to fuck with. With Oxymoron debuting at number one on the billboard charts, and having sold over 320,000 copies, it is safe to say that Q is Breaking the bank. 13. A$AP Rocky ft. Juicy J ""Multiply""After some uncharacteristic features, A$AP returned with one of the hardest hitting songs of the year in ""Multiply."" The Flacko flow is on full display from the start; his signature internal rhyming bounces up and down on the beat with such rhythm that it wouldn’t matter if he used to sell crack or lemonade in his living room

Don’t worry, you won’t be seeing an A$AP Lemonade Stand anytime soon as Rocky sticks to his typical rapper and fashion references. Throw in some Juicy J trash talk for good measure and A$AP’s only single since Long.Live.A$AP is one of the year’s best. Swag swag.12. Flying Lotus ft. Kendrick Lamar ""Never Catch Me""Like a psychedelic rat race, “Never Catch Me”  has Kendrick Lamar running circles around this Flying Lotus masterpiece. The fusion of hip hop, jazz, & electronic styles has Kendrick spazzing like a rabid dog. The L.A natives take you on an outer body experience to stare death right in the face. Every few bars the instrumental changes as the race continues, like Kendrick’s searching for something, getting faster, and faster, and as you reach your destination - “bitch, you’re dead!”11. Joey Bada$$ ""Christ Conscious (Toroidal Flow)""With an aggressive flow, Joey delivers a barrage of punchlines, wordplay, and utter energy that dazzles any listener. The beauty of these lyrical acrobats continues to prolong Joey’s ability and shows he ain’t no slacker when it comes down to the lyrics. Dragon Balls like his name was Vegeata, BADA$$  swears that no matter what, he won’t stop until he reaches the level of Christ Conscious.10. Run The Jewels ""Oh My Darling Don't Cry"" Anchored by an El-P instrumental that can only be described as manic, the dynamic duo laces the beat with rhymes that are crude, insightful, and simultaneously both. What separates it from other RTJ tracks is the erosion in differences between the styles and personalities of the lead rappers. On RTJ1, Mike and El were characterized as aggressive and philosophical, respectively. But here El has no problem telling you to “run backwards through a field of dicks” as Mike peruses Egyptian scriptures. The chemistry is palpable, the flows are indescribable, and the result is one of the highlights of 2014.9. Rich Gang ft. Birdman, Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug ""Lifestyle"" EUUGHBLAHBEAHELGWLINAHDEWFQLFKQWFN LLLLLLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFFFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEEEEEESTYLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEFor a song that made many detractors reconsider Rich Homie Quan’s “one-hit wonder status” and mainstream listeners delve into the Young Thug archives, the unintelligible nature of the lyrics for most listeners was its greatest asset: whatever personal details you added over the beat, you felt like your efforts were putting you on the fast-track to a Dionysian lifestyle of your own.8. ScHoolboy Q ft. BJ The Chicago Kid ""Studio""ScHoolboy Q put his heart on his sleeve in this banger for the ladies, elaborating on the reality that life as a major musician can be hectic. From touring around the world to TV appearances to, in this case, late nights in the studio, it can be hard to balance a relationship with a busy work schedule.7. J.Cole ""Fire Squad""If shock factor was what Cole was after with ""Fire Squad"" then he certainly achieved it. After boasting of his greatness in the first two verses, he took an interesting approach: highlighting white appropriation in the music of black culture. Not only did he just observe the sound-jacking, he name dropped some of the most well-known artists to ever do it.6. Bobby Shmurda ""Hot Nigga""The relationship between artist and subject matter, in the hip-hop and r&b genres especially, is a dangerously liminal one. When Rick Ross gets chastised for portraying a criminal mastermind following his career in law enforcement, are we supposed to then turn around and congratulate Bobby Shmurda and his crew for their string of summer smashes for existing in a realm of authenticity? It wasn’t the lyrics, nor the beat (on its second go-around, no less!) that made Bobby so hot. So when the chant-worthy one-liners become appear as more than fiction, should we cheer? Should we scold? Or should we Shmoney Dance the troubles away?!5. Logic ""Under Pressure""The title track of the album is reminiscent of Logic’s classic brag pieces, entailing his recent rise in popularity and success. Where the initial four-minute release dropped off is the track’s elegant yet radical style shift - it transitions from his recent material success to a deeply introspective track reflecting on both his past and current state of affairs with family. This track serves as the crown jewel of the album - a diamond created from being under pressure.4. Big Sean ft. E-40 ""I Don't Fuck With You""Sean Don and Bay Area godfather E-40 went big this year with the anthem for those without fucks to give. This track dropped along with “Paradise”, “4th Quarter”, and “Jit/Juke"" through his website following the announcement of his signing to Roc Nation. The song samples “Say You Love Me”, as part of the exemplary accompaniment of Coach Kanye and DJ Mustard on the beat. His blatantly vulgar lyrics clearly express his lack of interest in those he is not ""down with"" and is reminiscent of “I Don’t Give A Fuck” from Bo$$. While it has been confirmed that the record is not meant to be a shot to anyone in particular (including Naya Rivera with whom he recently split,) the message is still….Who ever I don't fuck with, I still don't fuck with you.3. Big K.R.I.T.	""Mt. Olympus""Post KRIT's 2013 release, King Remembered In Time, more verbal lightning from Krizzle became high in demand, and he delivered. ""Mt. Olympus"" sees K.R.I.T. punish all the heathens of the rap game, showing them there really is a god. The fans wonder, ""Is he rap, is he snap?"". ""Is he bass, is he drank?"" Neither - he is a King Remembered in Time.2. Drake ""0-100/The Catch Up""If there's one thing we've learned, it's that every song really does sound like Drake featuring Drake. ""Started from the bottom, now we here"" may have been 2013's catchphrase, but ""0 to 100 nigga, real quick"" took 2014 over almost as quickly as fans grabbed the free Soundcloud download of this track after its June release

The two-part track is a variety pack, filled with braggadocio, meme-worthy lines, and introspective thoughts. What makes ""0 to 100/The Catch Up"" so notable is the instantaneous shift from straight fire bars to a calmer profession of the same sentiment: Drake is perched at the top of the rap game and he's only getting better. That's a scary thought. We've already begun to see Drake back up these claims in his latest releases, and it's safe to say the anticipation for his next full-length project is nearly off the charts.1. Kendrick Lamar ""i""Backed by funky production reminiscent of the wonder years of soul music, Kendrick broadcasts a message of self love.  The best messages are those easily understood, and Kendrick makes no mistakes with a simple ""I love myself""

Similar to our number one song last year, Kanye West's ""New Slaves"", every facet of the song’s concept was handled in one spectacularly orchestrated move. Whether it be the record, the music video, or the buzz - each element illustrates the message crystal clear. An anthem isn't created overnight, this song has been in Kendrick all his life. They can lock ya body, they can’t trap ya mind.

Yeah (For your eyes)
For your eyes only (For your eyes)
For your eyes only, for your eyes only
(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only
[Chorus: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you hearing this, unfortunately means
That I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of 13
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
""What the fuck we naming this girl?""
I told her ""Nina,"" the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was 19
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand

For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?

For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only
[Chorus: CharGaux & J. Cole]
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing, when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects""
I had to interject like:
""Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?""
He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready""
And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first to get some pussy 12 years old
Not because he used to come through in the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, ""Fuck the law""
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you
For your eyes only226Embed"

I wanna fold clothes for you
Woke up this morning
Feeling like the best version of me, so happy
I walked in the living room
And saw you all alone on the couch, just napping
I, I see a lot on your plate
Nine months with that weight
I know you tired so I wonder how I can help
I get the basket and grab your clothes out the dryer
Oh, I wanna fold clothes for you

Listen, this is a meditation for me
A practice in being present
There's nowhere I need to be
Except right here with you

Watching Netflix
Catching up on our shows
Eating breakfast

With bananas and some almond milk

Niggas from the hood is the best actors
We the ones that got to wear our face backwards
Put your frown on before they think you soft
Never smile long or take your defense off
Acting tough so much, we start to feel hard
Live from the city where they pull cards
I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
Gotta learn to speak in ways that's unnatural
Just to make it through the job interviews
If my niggas heard me, they'd say
""Damn, what's gotten into you?""
Just trying to make it, dog, somehow
Peeking through the blinds, I see the sun now
I see you're still sleeping and it feels like

You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen courtrooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so
[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Outro: Kanye West & Big Sean]
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce back, bounce, bounce

I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

[Chorus]
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
[Verse 2]
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me too
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

[Chorus]
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better

Take my hand, we'll be fine

To somebody in a world where they not lovin' me
Handcuffs keep huggin' the, wrists of my niggas
And I wish stuff was different here
But if I had a magic wand to make the evil disappear
That means that there would be no Santa Claus no more
To bring you Christmas cheer
'Cause what he represents is really greed
And the need to purchase shit from corporations
That make a killin' because they feed
On the wallets of the poor who be knockin' on they door
Every Black Friday just to get some shit they can't afford
Even with the discount, write a check, that shit bounce
But as long as we got credit, it don't matter, the amount
We just swipin' shit here, we don't love, we just likin' shit here
What's that smell? Where's your diaper shit here?
Lay on your back, don't pee right now
Or else I'll have to get you back
One day when you gon' want to get your way
Yeah I'll have fun with that
Reminisce when you came out the womb
Tears of joy I think filled up the room
You are now the reason that I fight

Be like this, be like this

[Verse 1]
Yeah, life is a balance
You lose your grip, you can slip into an abyss
No doubt, you see these niggas trippin'
Ego in charge of every move, he's a star
And we can't look away due to the days that he caught our hearts
He's fallin' apart, but we deny it
Justifying that half ass shit he dropped, we always buy it
When he tell us he a genius but it's clearer lately
It's been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
There was a time when this nigga was my hero, maybe
That's the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
'Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he
The type of nigga swear he real but all around him's fake
The women, the dickriders, you know, the yes men
Nobody with the balls to say somethin' to contest him
So he grows out of control
Into the person that he truly was all along, it's startin' to show
Damn, wonder what happened
Maybe it's my fault for idolizin' niggas
Based off the words they be rappin'
But come to find out, these niggas don't even write they shit
Hear some new style bubblin' up, then they bite this shit
Damn, that's what I get for lyin' to myself
Well, fuck it, what's more important is he's cryin' out for help
While the world's eggin' him on, I'm beggin' him to stop it
Playin' his old shit, knowin' he won't top it

And I know he so bitter he can't see his own blessings
Goddamn, nigga, you too blind to see you got fans, nigga
And a platform to make a classic rap song
To change a nigga's life, but you too anxious livin' life
Always worried 'bout the critics who ain't ever fuckin' did it
I write what's in my heart, don't give a fuck who fuckin' with it
But in a sense I can relate, the need to be great
Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
Writin' words, hopin' people observe the dedication
That stirs in you constantly, but intentions get blurred
Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me?

They talk about being a man so much
I finally understand that they ain't even sure
'Bout who they are and why they do this
Guess I'm included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory
My highest moments come from tellin' all the saddest stories
I've seen in my life, I be fiendin' to write
Songs that raise the hair on my arms
My lowest moments came from tryin' too hard
To impress some niggas that couldn't care if I'm on
Therefore from here on out, my hair grow out
I care nothin' 'bout opinions
I wanna give hope like the fountains you throw pennies in
Hit the store, take your diss, make your wish
This is dedicated to the ones that listen to me on some faithful shit

Pockets full of cheese, bitch, I got racks

I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax

'Til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house

Thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playin' Nintendo
I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade, I got caught with a pistol
Sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade, started playin' football
Then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade, I was knocking niggas out

Fast forward, nigga, 2016
And I'm screamin' fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick
I don't even need a pill
I listened to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissin' on Twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'Til a nigga get killed
'Til a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled

You've gotta stop holding me the way you do

I hit you up like ""Do you wanna hang right now?""
On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now
You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now
It's after 2AM and that's askin' a lot of you right now

I been up for two whole days thinkin' what I did to keep you goin'
Thumbin' through the voicemails that you left me tellin' me where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded, no (Yeah, you said that)

I know you got another nigga tryna play the part
Just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart
Could be standin' in a field, and he still ain't in the field
If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questionin' what you get out the deal
Doin' things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when I'm comin' home?
That way you can be prepared

You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool
When I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed

But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try

Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know where I cannot go
Where I long to be

I know everybody on this island seems so happy, on this island
Everything is by design

But today? The revenge
Trust dawg finna cook
A Utah Jazz nigga used to not gettin’ calls for the push
Bitch, I’m darin’ him
Arrogance
Today, stop my comparisons
You tired of these battles, Glu’? True, I share the narratives
‘Cause I’m fatigued, too- nigga, the difference is I’m wearin’ ‘em!
It’s soldier shit
Fold ya shit, left to leak him crazy
White’ll drip on my wrists like before you feed the baby!
Tell Smack he need to pay me
You never been crackin’
(*swoo-swoo*) Cut before he go: that’s a severance package
Is Glu’ still shell-dumpin’?
Career is stale from it
Like how do you say your grace knowin’ how far you fell from it?
It’s Hell from it, I bell-rung him
Glu’, what you cook is not as dope
Email on my phone: see...I just push the envelope
I risk it all - bitch, get off
Lose and I get right back
These rounds worth triple his: I’m shootin’ from the Sprite rack
Assumin' he don't like that, but facts, his fall comin'
Don't ask to stall nothin'
The big axe is Paul Bunyan
Blood splatter from his bladder, docs was all buggin'
Like, ""We knew he was bold, but can't believe the gall of him""
Bitch, I’m bodyin’ all of ‘em!
Been wit’ the shit whenever
You switched ya clique to better, your stock, then switched your feathers
Ain’t that prove you was defective when the Goonies split forever?
‘Cause them niggas added Glu(e), then they couldn’t stick together!
Now you jokin’ in your rounds, is how the fans bought him
Glu’, I don’t dance for ‘em
You laugh, I stand taller
True clown vs. profound - Smack, this a bad offer
Put your mans in front of laughter and it led to manslaughter!
Bitch, fuck if your cans brought up!
Yo’ gun, shit never mentioned
To kill Em’ Kennedy, that would be un-President-ed (unprecedented)
Me? Steel never sing
But he? Skill never bring
There’s thousands on the line...so E feel menacing
It’s crazy one comma cause E (kamikaze) to kill everything!
And ooh, I’m dumbin’ out!
The fools’ll run they mouth
You run amok, get tummy-tucked, remove your gut and pouch
You know you gotta turn to staples when the Glu(e) is runnin’ out!
I am sure that you spark lead!

A good white father is still worse than a bad Black one!
That same skin is needed, your presence barely changin’ him
You teachin’ him to trust same skin that I’m stranglin’!
Did I just hit the vein of him!?
Well, stay where you from
‘Cause this face you’ve become ain’t the race he has won

And stop sayin’ you a cracker!

But the guidance you applyin’ is for your children comin’ after
So when you demean yourself for approval in front of rappers
It’s only teachin’ your son that he a nigga in front of crackers
You don’t see how that’s movin’ backwards?
The plight is through and through
To your son, you’ll just become another white that skews the truth
And my daddy was a junkie, son
So I’m fightin’ dude for you

All cap: it’s Meg Griffin

I’m winnin’, this instant
And you a small soldier, that run as a boss over
Shit went left like crossover
Laminate his death certificate...need me to talk slower?
I threatened wit’ you that before...but it was somethin’ you glossed over
Got colder, tres to witness, E’s outrageous writtens
I don’t really gun-bar, but for racks, I’m raisin’ Biscuits
Catch the apple of your eye, be forced to blaze your missus
Is that boring you, Glu(e)? Well, I’m tryna gauge your interests
Aftermath was Shady business!
Broad finna bleed!
What I’m airin’ left her barren (Barron)
Is that hard to conceive!?
The best bars in the league!
I should slide him if he talk!
But clauses in that contract signin’ if we fought…
So presidential race: I’m abidin’ (Biden) by default

And these are gems I am givin’ you
Know what you listenin’ to

That’s a 30 clip

Look, how you pro-Black, but dye your hair blonde like you a girl?
Your daddy Black, your mama white
He got the best of both worlds
But you up here rappin’ for shock value
What, you askin’ for some drama?
So if there really was a race war, I hope your daddy kill ya mama!
What’s the problem?
I can’t fire back at these racists?
I gotta bite my tongue and watch my statements?
Go home to my black son and try to explain it
Like the shit that’s he’s sayin’ is just entertainment!?
Fuck that!
I’ll ruin every picture you paintin’
You put Glue in ya raps I put clip in a stainless
White boy from the hood
The way I live is dangerous
So if the culture cancels me, you gon' have to cancel your prior engagements
It's crazy, how you rap streets
That shit got us all in disbelief
Just rap
We don't wanna hear that bullshit Shareef
This SMACK, you diss me, after this can fight about it

I know I’m probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn’t know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish it wasn't 4 AM, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run
[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

[Verse 2]
I know I’m probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it’s always on your terms
I’m hanging on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But your jealousy, I can hear it now
You’re talking down to me like I'll always be around
You push my love away like it's some kind of loaded gun
Boy, you never thought I’d run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again

I came up from Texas and now that we textin'
You can fly in whenever, now you undressin'
Panties on the dresser, your hair gettin' messed up

And I swear too much on the regular

Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow

Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy

Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed

All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, makin' sure I'm gettin' home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk 'round with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor

It's funny watchin' 'em do the way they do
They come walkin' up to me but they only wanna talk to you

18 yaşıma girdiğimde ağlamayı bıraktım
Beni sokaklar dışında kimse bu noktaya getirmedi
Çünkü çok fazla insan beni bu noktaya getirdiğini düşünüyor
Madem öyle, beni bu noktaya getiren onlar o zaman yerime bir başkasını koysunlar
Evsizlikten Forbest Listesine, bu zenciler strese neden olmuyor
Kendimi Musa gibi hissediyorum, seçilmiş kişi gibi hissediyorum
Ve eğer benim zencim değilsen o zaman sevgilin bana aittir
Zenci beni tanıdığını söylese bile umrumda değil
Babasız büyüdüm o yüzden kimse bana ”oğlum” demedi
Flowum çok fena, Kevin Costner bile bana yetişemez*
Hiçbir zaman beni kimsenin sevmemesini istediğini biliyorum
Hiç para kazanamadığımda kendimi işe yaramaz hissediyorum
İşte, her zaman hayalini kurduğumuz hayat bu
Queen Street zencinin gözlerinde zengin insanların sorunu
Ne zaman Aventadors'ta durduğumu görsen
Bil ki sadece kaldırımlara ekleme yaptırıyoruzdur

Sundance Head,,True,0,89,89,At Last,1,2016-12-31,"The Way to Rainy Mountain LyricsA single knoll rises out of the plain in Oklahoma, north and west of the Wichita Range. For my people, the Kiowas, it is an old landmark, and they gave it the name Rainy Mountain. The hardest weather in the world is there. Winter brings blizzards, hot tornadic winds arise in the spring, and in summer the prairie is an anvil's edge. The grass turns brittle and brown, and it cracks beneath your feet. There are green belts along the rivers and creeks, linear groves of hickory and pecan, willow and witch hazel. At a distance in July or August the steaming foliage seems almost to writhe in fire. Great green and yellow grasshoppers are everywhere in the tall grass, popping up like corn to sting the flesh, and tortoises crawl about on the red earth, going nowhere in the plenty of time.

Loneliness is an aspect of the land. All things in the plain are isolate; there is no confusion of objects in the eye, but one hill or one tree or one man. To look upon that landscape in the early morning, with the sun at your back, is to lose the sense of proportion. Your imagination comes to life, and this, you think, is where Creation was begun.

I returned to Rainy Mountain in July. My grandmother had died in the spring, and I wanted to be at her grave. She had lived to be very old and at last infirm. Her only living daughter was with her when she died, and I was told that in death her face was that of a child.

I like to think of her as a child. When she was born, the Kiowas were living the last great moment of their history. For more than a hundred years they had controlled the open range from the Smoky Hill River to the Red, from the headwaters of the Canadian to the fork of the Arkansas and Cimarron. In alliance with the Comanches, they had ruled the whole of the southern Plains. War was their sacred business, and they were among the finest horsemen the world has ever known. But warfare for the Kiowas was preeminently a matter of disposition rather than of survival, and they never understood the grim, unrelenting advance of the U.S. Cavalry. When at last, divided and ill provisioned, they were driven onto the Staked Plains in the cold rains of autumn, they fell into panic. In Palo Duro Canyon they abandoned their crucial stores to pillage and had nothing then but their lives. In order to save themselves, they surrendered to the soldiers at Fort Sill and were imprisoned in the old stone corral that now stands as a military museum. My grandmother was spared the humiliation of those high gray walls by eight or ten years, but she must have known from birth the affliction of defeat, the dark brooding of old warriors.

Her name was Aho, and she belonged to the last culture to evolve in North America. Her forebears came down from the high country in western Montana nearly three centuries ago. They were a mountain people, a mysterious tribe of hunters whose language has never been positively classified in any major group. In the late seventeenth century they began a long migration to the south and east. It was a journey toward the dawn, and it led to a golden age. Along the way the Kiowas were befriended by the Crows, who gave them the culture and religion of the Plains. They acquired horses, and their ancient nomadic spirit was suddenly free of the ground. They acquired Tai-me, the sacred Sun Dance doll, from that moment the object and symbol of their worship, and so shared in the divinity of the sun. Not least, they acquired the sense of destiny, therefore courage and pride. When they entered upon the southern Plains they had been transformed. No longer were they slaves to the simple necessity of survival; they were a lordly and dangerous society of fighters and thieves, hunters and priests of the sun. According to their origin myth, they entered the world through a hollow log. From one point of view, their migration was the fruit of an old prophecy, for indeed they emerged from a sunless world.

Although my grandmother lived out her long life in the shadow of Rainy Mountain, the immense landscape of the continental interior lay like memory in her blood. She could tell of the Crows, whom she had never seen, and of the Black Hills, where she had never been. I wanted to see in reality what she had seen more perfectly in the mind's eye, and traveled fifteen hundred miles to begin my pilgrimage.
Yellowstone, it seemed to me, was the top of the world, a region of deep lakes and dark timber, canyons and waterfalls. But, beautiful as it is, one might have the sense of confinement there. The skyline in all directions is close at hand, the high wall of the woods and deep cleavages of shade. There is a perfect freedom in the mountains, but it belongs to the eagle and the elk, the badger and the bear. The Kiowas reckoned their stature by the distance they could see, and they were bent and blind in the wilderness.

Descending eastward, the highland meadows are a stairway to the plain. In July the inland slope of the Rockies is luxuriant with flax and buckwheat, stonecrop and larkspur. The earth unfolds and the limit of the land recedes. Clusters of trees, and animals grazing far in the distance, cause the vision to reach away and wonder to build upon the mind. The sun follows a longer course in the day, and the sky is immense beyond all comparison. The great billowing clouds that sail upon it are shadows that move upon the grain like water, dividing light. Farther down, in the land of the Crows and Blackfeet, the plain is yellow. Sweet clover takes hold of the hills and bends upon itself to cover and seal the soil. There the Kiowas paused on their way; they had come to the place where they must change their lives. The sun is at home on the plains. Precisely there does it have the certain character of a god. When the Kiowas came to the land of the Crows, they could see the darklees of the hills at dawn across the Bighorn River, the profusion of light on the grain shelves, the oldest deity ranging after the solstices. Not yet would they veer southward to the caldron of the land that lay below; they must wean their blood from the northern winter and hold the mountains a while longer in their view. They bore Tai-me in procession to the east.

A dark mist lay over the Black Hills, and the land was like iron. At the top of a ridge I caught sight of Devil's Tower upthrust against the gray sky as if in the birth of time the core of the earth had broken through its crust and the motion of the world was begun. There are things in nature that engender an awful quiet in the heart of man; Devil's Tower is one of them. Two centuries ago, because they could not do otherwise, the Kiowas made a legend at the base of the rock. My grandmother said: Eight children were there at play, seven sisters and their brother. Suddenly the boy was struck dumb; he trembled and began to run upon his hands and feet. His fingers became claws, and his body was covered with fur. Directly there was a bear where the boy had been. The sisters were terrified; they ran, and the bear after them. They came to the stump of a great tree, and the tree spoke to them. It bade them climb upon it, and as they did so it began to rise into the air. The bear came to kill them, but they were just beyond its reach. It reared against the tree and scored the bark all around with its claws. The seven sisters were borne into the sky, and they became the stars of the Big Dipper.

From that moment, and so long as the legend lives, the Kiowas have kinsmen in the night sky. Whatever they were in the mountains, they could be no more. However tenuous their well-being, however much they had suffered and would suffer again, they had found a way out of the wilderness.

My grandmother had a reverence for the sun, a holy regard that now is all but gone out of mankind. There was a wariness in her, and an ancient awe. She was a Christian in her later years, but she had come a long way about, and she never forgot her birthright. As a child she had been to the Sun Dances; she had taken part in those annual rites, and by them she had learned the restoration of her people in the presence of Tai-me. She was about seven when the last Kiowa Sun Dance was held in 1887 on the Washita River above Rainy Mountain Creek. The buffalo were gone. In order to consummate the ancient sacrifice--to impale the head of a buffalo bull upon the medicine tree--a delegation of old men journeyed into Texas, there to beg and barter for an animal from the Goodnight herd.

She was ten when the Kiowas came together for the last time as a living Sun Dance culture. They could find no buffalo; they had to hang an old hide from the sacred tree. Before the dance could begin, a company of soldiers rode out from Fort Sill under orders to disperse the tribe. Forbidden without cause the essential act of their faith, having seen the wild herds slaughtered and left to rot upon the ground, the Kiowas backed away forever from the medicine tree. That was July 20, 1890, at the great bend of the Washita. My grandmother was there. Without bitterness, and for as long as she lived, she bore a vision of deicide.

Now that I can have her only in memory, I see my grandmother in the several postures that were peculiar to her: standing at the wood stove on a winter morning and turning meat in a great iron skillet; sitting at the south window, bent above her beadwork, and afterwards, when her vision failed, looking down for a long time into the fold of her hands; going out upon a cane, very slowly as she did when the weight of age came upon her; praying. I remember her most often at prayer. She made long, rambling prayers out of suffering and hope, having seen many things. I was never sure that I had the right to hear, so exclusive were they of all mere custom and company. The last time I saw her she prayed standing by the side of her bed at night, naked to the waist, the light of a kerosene lamp moving upon her dark skin. Her long, black hair, always drawn and braided in the day, lay upon her shoulders and against her breasts like a shawl. I do not speak Kiowa, and I never understood her prayers, but there was something inherently sad in the sound, some merest hesitation upon the syllables of sorrow. She began in a high and descending pitch, exhausting her breath to silence; then again and again--and always the same intensity of effort, of something that is, and is not, like urgency in the human voice. Transported so in the dancing light among the shadows of her room, she seemed beyond the reach of time. But that was illusion; I think I knew then that I should not see her again.

Houses are like sentinels in the plain, old keepers of the weather watch. There, in a very little while, wood takes on the appearance of great age. All colors wear soon away in the wind and rain, and then the wood is burned gray and the grain appears and the nails turn red with rust. The windowpanes are black and opaque; you imagine there is nothing within, and indeed there are many ghosts, bones given up to the land. They stand here and there against the sky, and you approach them for a longer time than you expect. They belong in the distance; it is their domain.

Once there was a lot of sound in my grandmother's house, a lot of coming and going, feasting and talk. The summers there were full of excitement and reunion. The Kiowas are a summer people; they abide the cold and keep to themselves, but when the season turns and the land becomes warm and vital they cannot hold still; an old love of going returns upon them. The aged visitors who came to my grandmother's house when I was a child were made of lean and leather, and they bore themselves upright. They wore great black hats and bright ample shirts that shook in the wind. They rubbed fat upon their hair and wound their braids with strips of colored cloth. Some of them painted their faces and carried the scars of old and cherished enmities. They were an old council of warlords, come to remind and be reminded of who they were. Their wives and daughters served them well. The women might indulge themselves; gossip was at once the mark and compensation of their servitude. They made loud and elaborate talk among themselves, full of jest and gesture, fright and false alarm. They went abroad in fringed and flowered shawls, bright beadwork and German silver. They were at home in the kitchen, and they prepared meals that were banquets.

There were frequent prayer meetings, and great nocturnal feasts. When I was a child I played with my cousins outside, where the lamplight fell upon the ground and the singing of the old people rose up around us and carried away into the darkness. There were a lot of good things to eat, a lot of laughter and surprise. And afterwards, when the quiet returned, I lay down with my grandmother and could hear the frogs away by the river and feel the motion of the air.

Now there is a funeral silence in the rooms, the endless wake of some final word. The walls have closed in upon my grandmother's house. When I returned to it in mourning, I saw for the first time in my life how small it was. It was late at night, and there was a white moon, nearly full. I sat for a long time on the stone steps by the kitchen door. From there I could see out across the land; I could see the long row of trees by the creek, the low light upon the rolling plains, and the stars of the Big Dipper. Once I looked at the moon and caught sight of a strange thing. A cricket had perched upon the handrail, only a few inches away from me. My line of vision was such that the creature filled the moon like a fossil. It had gone there, I thought, to live and die, for there, of all places, was its small definition made whole and eternal. A warm wind rose up and purled like the longing within me.
The next morning I awoke at dawn and went out on the dirt road to Rainy Mountain. It was already hot, and the grasshoppers began to fill the air. Still, it was early in the morning, and the birds sang out of the shadows. The long yellow grass on the mountain shone in the bright light, and a scissortail hied above the land. There, where it ought to be, at the end of a long and legendary way, was my grandmother's grave. Here and there on the dark stones were ancestral names. Looking back once, I saw the mountain and came away.Embed"

I've been staring at the edge of the water
Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try

[Pre-Chorus]
Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know, where I cannot go
Where I long to be
[Chorus]
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

[Verse 2]
I know everybody on this island seems so happy
On this island, everything is by design
I know everybody on this island has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?

[Chorus]
See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
But no one knows, how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me

To stretch your days and bring you fun
Also I harnessed the breeze, you're welcome
To fill your sails and shake your trees

Introduced her to my plug now she think she all that
When I first hit her up, no, she nevеr wrote back
Then I saw her at thе club, so I got up on that

And I know she know wassup baby this is my shit

Ich bin ein Lügner gewesen, ein Dieb gewesen
Ein Liebhaber gewesen, ein Betrüger gewesen
All meine Sünden brauchen heiliges Wasser, fühle es mich überspülen
Also, Kleines, ich möchte nichts zugeben
Wenn alles, was es bringt, Schmerz ist
Wahrheit und meine Lügen fallen grade wie der Regen
Also lass den Fluss strömen

[Part 1: Eminem]
Er kommt heim mit zerkratztem Hals, um Kritik einzustecken
Sweatjacke und Anzughose, nicht zusammenpassend
In seinem Atem Jack, er ist ein Sexsüchtiger
Und sie möchte nur Rache üben und zurückkommen
Es ist ein Schachspiel, sie ist hinter ihm her wie ein Jetpack
Sie behält die Übersicht über all seine Internetchats
Und ratet, wer gerade dabei ist, zur Nächsten weiterzuziehen
Tatsächlich, gerade auf mein letztes Mädchen gekackt und sie hat, was meiner Ex fehlt
Denn sie liebt Gefahr, Psychopath
Und du fickst mit niemandes Mädchen, selbst ich weiß das
Aber sie hat einen Plan entwickelt, ihm in den Rücken zu stechen
Messer in der Hand, sagt, dass ihre Beziehung an einer Strähne hängt
Also war sie neuerdings im Netz
Sagt, vielleicht wird sie meine Gwen Stacy sein, um ihren Mann zu ärgern
Und ich weiß, sie benutzt mich, um zu versuchen, ihn zu betrügen, mir egal
Hi Suzanne, aber ich hätte sagen sollen: „Bye Suzanne“
Nach der ersten Nacht, aber heute Nacht bin ich
[Refrain: Ed Sheeran]
Ich bin ein Lügner gewesen, ein Dieb gewesen
Ein Liebhaber gewesen, ein Betrüger gewesen
All meine Sünden brauchen heiliges Wasser, fühle es mich überspülen
Also, Kleines, ich möchte nichts zugeben
Wenn alles, was es bringt, Schmerz ist
Wahrheit und meine Lügen fallen grade wie der Regen
Also lass den Fluss strömen

[Bridge: Eminem]
One-Night-Stand, wurde zu einem Two-Night-Stand
Es war „Komm, Sonnenlicht, verschwinde“, jetzt umarmen wir uns fest und...

[Part 2: Eminem]
Er hat es rausgefunden, jetzt fühlt sie sich verlassen und benutzt
Denn er ist abgehauen, na und? Er hat es ihr außerdem zuerst angetan
Wie soll ich jetzt diesem Mädchen sagen, dass wir fertig sind?
Es ist hart, die Worte zu finden, ich bin reserviert, nervös, und Sue
Möchte nicht, dass das wehtut, aber was du verdienst ist die Wahrheit
Nimm es nicht persönlich, ich kann es dir einfach nicht persönlich sagen
Also kehre ich ins Studio zurück, wie Rattenloch-Diner
Muss in einer Kabine nicht reserviert sein
Ich fühle mich nur so, als wäre die Person, zu der ich werde
Unumkehrbar, ich habe auf dich Jagd gemacht, als wäre es Kirche auf der Kirchenbank
Und jetzt, wo ich dich habe, will ich dich nicht
Nutzte den Vorteil in meinem Verfolgungsdurst
Warum mache ich diesen Dreck, den ich mache?
Steige auf meine Tribüne und predige meine Predigt und Rede
Reinigungsmittel und Bleiche verbrennen die Wunde
Denn jetzt, mit ihr im Mutterleib
Können wir sie nicht in diese Welt bringen, hätten daran denken sollen
Schutz zu verwenden, bevor ich in deine verbotene Frucht gebissen habe
Fuck!

Immer die Brautjunger, niemals „die Braut, hey“
Was zum Teufel soll ich sagen? Wenn das Leben eine Schnellstraße wäre
Und Betrug eine Enklave, würde ich über fünf Fahrspuren schlingern
Die Geschwindigkeit ist enorm, als würde ich auf Eis rutschen, vielleicht
Ist das, warum ich dich vielleicht von der Seite angemacht habe
Ich kann meine Lügen nicht beisammen halten
Aber ich brachte dich dazu, mein Baby aufzulösen
Diese Dreiecksbeziehung ließ uns im Ruin zurück, verwirrt
Was kann ich noch sagen? Es hat eine Zeit lang Spaß gemacht
Wette, ich hätte dein Lächeln wirklich geliebt
Wollte nicht wirklich abtreiben, aber scheiß drauf
Was ist eine Lüge mehr, die wir unserem ungeborenen Kind erzählen?

Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (Ha-ha-ha)

Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other mad, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense

Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too

I'm in love with your body

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Si el ritmo te lleva a mover la cabeza ya empezamos cómo es
Mi música no discrimina a nadie así que vamos a romper
Con lo mío todos se mueven
La fiesta la llevo en mis genes
Yo soy la reina de los nenes
Mi gente no se detiene, aquí nadie se quiere ir
Si el ritmo está en tu cabeza
Ahora suéltate y mueve los pies
Me encanta cuando el bajo suena
Empezamos a subir de nivel
Toda mi gente se mueve
La fiesta la llevo en mis genes
Yo soy la reina de los nenes
Mi musica los tiene fuerte bailando y se baila así

Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his gut, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I'll fuck yo' bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo' ho if yo' bitch keep eyein' me!

Ich habe gebetet, damit mich jemand rettet, keiner ist heldenhaft

Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee Featuring Justin Bieber,,False,31,1,36,Despacito,49,2017-12-31,"Is Music Really Haram? The Sad Reality of Today’s Music. LyricsIs Music Really Haram?

It’s the question almost everyone wants to argue about and the debate that never seems to end.

And before you drop the “Haram Police” card and get ready to prepare an essay response in the comments, can I just say that I’m not here to argue the different rulings and opinions on musical instruments, singing, beat boxing, drums and what not. I’m not even going to go there.

I’m going to be doing something different.

I want us to answer this question for ourselves, openly and honestly. In fact, we can even forget I even said the word Haram to begin with.

Let’s instead just ask the question “Is Music harmful?”
And when we say music, I’m going to be very blank, I’m referring to the music that the majority of people are listening to today because that’s what we should be concerned about. The music that’s on our radios, TV’s, phones and iTunes playlists on repeat. The songs that are topping the charts week-in-week-out and have us memorizing their lyrics from A-Z. This is the music I’m referring to.

Should we, as Muslims be fine listening to this stuff?

Well, let’s take a look for yourselves and decide.

The Hot 100 Billboard Charts has these songs topping the charts for the current week.


Despacito:
Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee Featuring Justin Bieber

“You fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on”


Wild Thoughts:
DJ Khaled, Rhianna, Bryson Teller

“I don’t know if you could take it
Know you wanna see me nakey, nakey, naked”


That’s what I like:
Bruno Mars
“Go pop it for a player, pop-pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player, drop-drop it for me”


I’m the One:
DJ Khaled, Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne, Quavo

“Roll my eyes
And when she on the molly she a zombie”


Unforgettable:
French Montanna

“If you loved the girl then I’m so, so sorry
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage
No, no I won’t tell nobody”

“If you want drama, Grab the Uzi”.


A quick Google search of the lyrics of these songs will let you know exactly the kinds of messages they contain. You honestly don’t have to read far until you come across references to drugs, sexual promiscuity, violence or alcohol. Even when lyrics can seem somewhat innocent, they are underlined with the most vulgar and shameless of meanings. And the saddest part of it all, there’s even some Muslims actually making these songs.

And yes, I’m sure we can argue all day that not all songs are this bad and there are some “good songs” out there, but the fact of the matter is the statistics speak for themselves when they mention that the vast majority of today’s music is riddled with such references and as the day’s go by content is only getting worse.

And as I’ve mentioned before, I’m not here to argue the Islamic rulings on instruments and the various opinions of scholars on music, because, in all honesty, these opinions are irrelevant when we consider them in light of the music being listened to today. I mean, do you seriously want to argue the permissibility of instruments when Muslims are listening to Nicki Minaj?
And we can go ahead and argue that we’re strong and that the music isn’t necessarily influencing us, but the fact of the matter is – it does. And whether you realize it or not, when you constantly grant such music free access to your ears, it is affecting you. It’s normalizing the worst of sins to the point we can sing about them happily and joyfully.

And if you were so sure that the things you listen to won’t affect your life, why not switch up a music playlist with some Quran and see what change it would have in your life. Even if you don’t understand a word being recited, just listen to it and see what kind of impact it will leave on your soul. There’s no denying that our ears are gateways into our hearts and we should be very careful who we allow access to.

And lastly, I know we all have shortcomings and weaknesses, and I know not all of us are the perfect ideal Muslims – but the least we can do is acknowledge that it’s wrong so that perhaps we can start making an effort to change.

May Allah help us all.Embed"

Als wir etwas älter waren, beide sprangen

Selbst wenn wir Streiten würden, würden wir es nicht lange tuen
Und du verstehst, das Gute und das Schlechte enden in einem Song
Für alle deine wundervollen Eigenschaften und die Art, es mit Leichtigkeit zu tun
Für alle meine Fehler, Paranoia und Unsicherheiten
Ich habe Fehler gemacht und machen Entscheidungen getroffen, welche schwer zu verleugnen sind

But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
""Happy Christmas,"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you,"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears

I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice

Les rappeurs mentent, ils ont l'jeu d'acteur de Palpatine
En bas d'chez moi ça baroude, j'dirais plutôt ""ça barrode""
Déjà rentré des patates, déjà rentré des carottes
Des grosses voitures, voilà l'image qu'on véhicule
J'ai plongé dans l'illicite, les études comme pédiluve
La vie m'a fait de grands dégâts, je valais rien au top départ
Aujourd'hui j'fais ma vendetta, casse des bouches et tape des barres
J'arrive, bibendum, se-pha dans le barillet
Si j'déménage, peut-être que mes thèmes pourront varier
Paris est pas si magique, veux-tu parier
Des mecs de tess avec des sapes de marque et les dents cariées
T'as fait ci, t'as fait ça, ta té-ci n'est pas si sale
J'apprécie pas ton rap, que des bêtises abyssales
Là où j'vis, même les raclis veulent des couilles en or
J'encaisse les thunes et les coups, pas du clan des couillonneurs
Ceux qui sont pas contents n'ont qu'à s'lever
Dans la rue, si tu manques de flair, on te casse le nez
La punchline est complète, aucune demi-mesure
Si j'te dis qu't'es hors compète, tu réponds ""oui monsieur""
L'idéal : veski les keufs et la mettre aux meufs
Jamais tué personne, comme un neuf millimètres neuf
M'égaler, ceux qui le croient sont bé-chtar
Y en a très peu à ma taille, comme les jeans à G-Star
J'ai enterré mes rêves de gosse devant le zapping
On pleure plus en public, même si parfois ça pique
Ils nous diabolisent, c'est qu'un vice de plus
On est des enfants d'la télé, eux des fils de pute
Torrent d'cyprine quand ta bitch entend mon nom
2012, le ton a durci, j'mets du vin dans mon eau
Le peura ça vend pas, n'écoute pas c'qui s'évente
Deux-mille téléchargements, enlève deux zéros pour les ventes
Toujours pas au goût des élégantes dames
La vraie beauté est intérieure, à part pour Elephant Man
Allez nique ta race, toi et tes r'frains chantonnés
Ça sort les teilles de champagne, leur public boit du Champomy
Coffee G., on ouvre les portes avec des clés d'bras
Tes blessures, c'est rien, comparé à nos plaies d'braves
Casserole sur la plaque, méfiez-vous de l'eau qui dort
Ma fierté ne s'achète pas, même contre des lokis d'or
Tise et drogue, malheureusement c'qui fait tourner l'four
Triste époque, le marchand d'sable passe au Redbull
J'voulais graisser les épinards, mais téma le prix d'la crème
J'ai vu les grands faire du blé, alors j'en ai pris d'la graine
On s'en sert peu, on vient remettre le couvert
Levez les majeurs, moi j'm'en bats les reins des pouces verts
Piano-zouk-électro, les mecs de tess m'ont déçu
Y'aurait des strings Prada, ils se jetteraient tous dessus
Visent la plus belle, chouf un peu à quoi ça mène
Amène les camions-poubelles, beaucoup trop de sacs à merde
Provoque pas trop, même si j'ai le cœur à Coluche
Avant qu'je sorte les griffes, on me prenait pour une peluche
Pas de grand public, uniquement des chrysanthèmes
J'élargirai pas mon boule pour élargir ma clientèle
Manque de nettoyage, les nuls se banalisent tant
N'importe qui s'incruste, comme en Afghanistan
Sois tranquille, on se charge d'écumer
Les rappeurs veulent me mettre un patch pour que j'arrête de les fumer
Peu importe la couleur, ensemble on fait des merveilles
On saigne tous, notre rap est dans la même veine
Blanc, jaune, métissé, couleur ébène
La route est longue entre le square Léon et le jardin d'Éden
Dérange pas si ça dîne, les concurrents, j'les abîme
Je prends du poids, les asticots se lèchent les babines
Baise les nouveaux puristes, jeunes mais déjà séniles
Ils écouteraient même du Bieber, du moment qu'c'est sur vinyle
J'ai changé depuis la dernière fois
J'suis pas une star, j'fais couler l'sang, le tapis rouge, il est derrière moi
Pessimiste, avec quelques sautes d'humour
Recule de quelques pas, y a qu'mes poignées qui sont d'amour
Ton buzz est dead, et ta cote se meurt
J't'anéantis en un clin d'œil, à la Scott Summers
Trop de bâtards, j'demande qu'à les achever
Pour les compter sur mes doigts, y m'faudrait le corps à Shiva
Le rôle de l'antihéros, chaque cité a son barde
On a des gueules de terros, avec ou sans la barbe
Demande pas si ça roule à un brancardier
Mon arrondissement est riche, contrairement à mon quartier
J'ai le blues de l'école ""Hoochie Coochie Man""
Viens pas demander un feat' si t'as le flow à Gucci Mane
Chez moi, y a que les Marocains qui partent au Maroc
Poésie baroque, gris et solide comme un roc
Pas sérieux, ça baise des 'tasses pas très malignes
J'écrirais pas comme ça sans garder cette adrénaline
T'avais juré d'arrêter, mais tu la tires d'un trait la ligne
Personne n'a témoigné de ce qui s'passe après la vie
Appelle-moi Toubab Shakur, a.k.a. l'baron
J'leur mets tellement de gifles qu'ils m'confondent avec le daron
Belek à ma big team, baise tout et casse les murs
T'es qu'une victime, même sur Facebook, tu rases les murs
C'est qu'on est pas passés par là si tu vois pas d'sang
T'avais prévu d'exploser, j'ai entendu qu'un clac-doigt
T'avais du buzz, t'as flambé, t'as vendu quatre-cent
T'arrêtes pour raison religieuses, allez casse-toi
Y a les statues géantes et y a les figurines
Y a ceux qui grattent des seize mesures et ceux qui grattent des featurings
Ceux qui lâchent un son par an et ceux qui saignent à l'usine
Ceux qui accusent la distrib' et ceux qui améliorent leur musique
J'vise pas l'oscar, propos limites
Ça m'est égal que la critique ma taille une pipe ou un costard
J'étais juste venu boire, ils m'ont fait trinquer
Mutilation du track, tu kiffes pas, t'es détraqué
Rangez vos albums, c'est d'la qualité bootleg
Leur son tourne en rond, et le mien tourne en boucle
Ça sonne sale malgré la qualité sonore
Chaque mesure fait mal, tu vas valider l'ceau-mor
Que des joueurs de trompette, sortez les cuivres
J'me renseigne sur les modes pour être sûr de pas les suivre
Grosse merde, crari tu fréquentes les hautes sphères
Ferme un peu ta grande gueule, tu pollues mon atmosphère
Ton flow est sucré, moi j'utilise des mots amers
Le rap sans moi, comme une cité sans famille Mohamed
Tu loues des Ferrari, alors qu'tu roules en Lada
J'vais pas viser ta tête, vu qu'elle te sert à nada
Ni le tiékar ni la Lune, j'vise la galaxie
J'me prends pas pour un Noir, nique le Galak
Si ça fonctionne pas, j'passe au rock à la Barrett Syd
Mes potes sont des vrais, pas des gratteurs de garette-ci
Ça cherche des méthodes pour du talent, pourtant y en a pas quarante
T'as vendu ton âme au diable, apparemment tu t'es fait carotte
Tu pues la défaite, que des phases pour gamines
Et tu fais plus de name-dropping que Raito Yagami
Ceux qui ont le moins sont ceux qui montrent le plus
Le temps passe aussi vite sur une montre de luxe
Je danse pas, je mate les culs, près d'la buvette
Me parle pas d'vécu, j'ai vu plus de merde qu'une cuvette
Ma mission : tuer les faux, bien sûr dédicacer les bons
Mon flow est lourd, il a peur de traverser les ponts
Ils veulent ma mort, j'les vois en face, ils s'mettent en r'trait
PD, tu vas rien faire, va jouer aux fléchettes sur mon portrait
Je rappe mieux qu'toi, c'est une certitude
Essaie de nous maquer, tu vas connaître la servitude
Qui veut voler mon or, mon art
La rondelle en bon état, y a qu'à la science que j'peux donner mon corps
Tu sais qui c'est, pas b'soin de répétition
Dis c'que tu veux, j'écouterai pas, t'es comme le diététicien
Tout c'qui m'sépare des mecs en major, c'est le manque de sous
Les beatmakers, avis à vous, braqueur de banques de sons
J'amène du sang frais, j'attire les piranhas
T'as testé, t'as mérité ta gifle comme Rihanna
C'est pas du hard rock, mais j'veux voir des pogos
Si c'était moi qu'avait croqué, Apple n'aurait plus d'logo
J'ai violé l'instru, j'ai ma place au PS
Tu critiques mais tu branles rien, comme le prof d'EPS
Le rap a pécho l'HIV, ce titre est là pour l'achever
Ne pas déranger, j'écris votre futur album de chevet
Cevi t'es gang, t'es inconnu en tess
Tu vas en voir de toutes les couleurs comme une shneck hollandaise
Sur ma tête pas d'auréole, tout sauf malléable
Représente les halls, sûrement pas les Halles
J'perds mon temps à espérer que jamais mon réveille sonne
Gratter des putain d'phases écoutées par cinquante personnes
Ça bicrave pour grailler autre chose que des döners
C'est pas une question d'bonheur, c'est une question d'honneur
C'est pas d'la snap, Bazoo jamais loin du snack
Des envies d'autodafé dès que j'mets les pieds en Fnac
Ils parlent de Merco, j'connais l'numéro d'bus de ces tomis
Habitué d'la street, j'ai chauffé l'banc, plus que Citony
Joue pas l'cow-boy, sinon tu finis scalpé
L'union fait la force, à part pour ton équipe de dalepés
Avant d'lâcher ma passion, je périrai
Si le rap se montre patient, j'le guérirai
Bûcheron, révolue l'époque timorée

Es ist nicht gut genug für mich
Seitdem ich mit dir gewesen bin, ooh
Es wird nicht mit dir funktionieren
Niemand kann mich gleich machen (Ich weiß)
Ich werde an diesem Drink nippen, wenn ich im Arsch bin
Ich sollte wissen wie man aufgabelt
Ich werde den Rhythmus bekommen
Während sie gegen mich drückt, ooh, ist sie angeschwipst?
Hatte genug Konversation für 24
Ich gucke dich durch den ganzen Raum an
Schöner kleiner Körper, tanzt wie Gogo, hey
Und du bist unvergessbar
Ich muss dafür sorgen, dass du alleine bist (oeh)
Warum nicht? Eine verdammt gute Zeit hat noch niemanden geschadet
Ich hab einen kleinen Drink, aber es nicht Barcadi
Wenn du das Mädchen liebtest, tut es mir sehr, sehr leid
Ich muss es ihr geben als wären wir in einer Ehe
Oh, als wären wir in Eile
Nein, nein, ich werde es niemanden erzählen
Du bist auch auf deinem Level
Versuchen zu machen, was Liebhaber tun
[Part 1: French Montana]
Fühle mich als wäre ich frisch raus; Boosie
Wenn sie das Drama wollen, hab ich die Uzi
Schiffe die ganze Crew zum Kreuzfahrtschiff
Machen Scheiße, die du nicht mal in Filmen siehst
Fahr mit mir, fahr mit mir, Boss
Ich hab einen harten Kopf, aber ihr Arsch ist weich
Sie will den Nachnamen mit dem Ring darauf
Weil ich holte eine Millionen raus, sagte ihr, sie soll drauf planken

[Bridge: Swae Lee & French Montana]
Und du bist unvergessbar
Ich muss dafür sorgen, dass du alleine bist
Jetzt willst du dir aussuchen
Lass den Champagner im 'Cuzi einfach spritzen

Don't get close to me
Hugging my Rosary

Mama would hustle

Daddy would stunt
He would pull up at ac

With a Cuban to match

Back I use to put on the throwback
Back when I use to just play the backcourt
Back when  I use to wear the jansport

Just the rhyme book I swear
Pull up to the show
And queens  and Brooklyn here

Baby I'm a poet
Playa playa
And I play heroic
I ain't saving hoes
Screaming fuck the labels
As I walk in  label door
I'm a labor man
I'm a work horse
Even when I stay at home
I don't never take work off
Before I sweat a bitch
I rather porn Hub
And Just jerk off
You a jerk off
Like stone cold
With a six pack
With the beer belly
And the shirt off
Hit with the stunner
Man I just had the worse  summer
So I'm kicking doors
And breaking numbers
Kicking like the baby
In your baby mama
She Gon make hit with the anacoda
Bless her with the force and some marijuana
With no Benny Hanna
Just some chicken nuggets
Gucci gold

To give me the coochie to go
I told her to rub
On my coogie for luck
I told her
Don't act like she booshie as fuck
I told her
Go listen to Gucci instead
I got me a yella
She bump the Kodak
I met her miami
That night in the sand
I told her to read all the signs in my hand
She told me the vision was safe and clear
She wanted a Kodak
A pic from the gram
She told me I was becoming a man
The picture Was only because I'm the man
I was just a baby boy

Getting dropped off at my school

Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom

Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever

Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and

They said I was nothing but a troublemaker
Never up to no good
You were the perfect All-American girl
Wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window every night, riding shotgun in my car
We'd go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen
[Verse 2]
So you went off to college and I got a job
I was workin' that 9 to 5
Dreamin' of the days when you were in my arms, I had never felt so alive
I spent my days workin', spent my nights drinkin'
Howlin' at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No it couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

[Chorus 2]
When I was gonna be your forever
And you were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better and I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 3]
So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure, we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee
And I said

I was thinkin' 'bout the band
I was thinkin' 'bout the fans
We were underground
Loadin' merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growin' up, still growin' up
I would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be some
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days

I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days

And all these reckless nights you won't regret

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Wish I didn't think I had the answers
Wish I didn't drink all of that flask first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open, and the stars above
Moment frozen, sneakin' out, and fallin' in love
Me, you and that futon, we'd just begun
On the grass dreamin', figuring out who I was
Those good old days

I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days

Addison Agen,,True,0,67,67,Tennessee Rain,1,2017-12-31,"Tennessee Rain Lyrics[Verse 1]
You never see it coming, it happens all of a sudden
And when it finally hits you, it's too late
He just sat there in the silence, on his own private island
I wasn't ready for the storm about to break
Yesterday, there was no trace of trouble
Now he's given up more than I can take

[Chorus]
He said hold on tight, it's gonna be a heck of a night
Especially when you hear what I've got to say
And when he said, I don't love you
The first tear broke through
Now it's comin' down
Like a Tennessee rain
[Verse 2]
Nobody showed me, nobody told me
What to do when the story turned out wrong
Or how a heart does its mending, without the perfect ending
The one I always thought would come along
He had his own ideas of where this love was going
He wasn't leaving it up to the hands of fate

[Chorus]
He just said hold on tight, it's gonna be a heck of a night
Especially when you hear what I've got to say
And when he said, I don't love you
The first tear broke through
Now it's comin' down
Like a Tennessee rain

[Chorus]
He said hold on tight, it's gonna be a heck of a night
Especially when you hear what I've got to say
And when he said, I don't love you
The first tear broke through
Now it's comin' down

Eminem Featuring Beyonce,,False,0,14,87,Walk On Water,4,2017-12-31,"Walk on Water Lyrics[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (Fuck)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark’s high, butter–
Flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—
[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the—, it's the curse of the—)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven’t spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I’ve garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin’ the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage!""
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so…

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's—, it's true—)
But only when it freezes
(It's true—)

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's true, I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
Pectations and meet 'em, but first
The ""Speedom"" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike

Turn me on turn me off then you turn me back on by the weekend
And you won’t say the words that I want but you flirt when you’re drinkin’
I see those bubbles pop up like you’re texting then they disappear
Lets cut through the shit then let’s get to what we’re doing here

[Chorus]
Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand
Are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand
[Verse 2]
Yeah, I want you to want me to take you back home to my mama
Put my name on your lips call me yours and forget all this drama
Your makeup is next to my toothbrush but you never put it away on the shelf
I'm asking you baby 'cause i’m tired of asking myself

[Chorus]
Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand
Are we last call kissing, are we dancing in the kitchen, baby tell me what it is or what it isn't
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Look, I didn't power through the struggle
Just to let a little trouble, knock me out of my position
And interrupt the vision
After everything I witnessed, after all of these decisions
All these miles, feet, inches
They can't add up to the distance
That I have been through, just to get to
A place where even if there's no closure, I'm still safe
I still ache from trying to keep pace
Somebody give me a sign, I'm starting to lose faith

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Harris & Machine Gun Kelly]
Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair

Eminem,,True,0,92,92,Believe,1,2017-12-31,"Believe Lyrics[Verse 1]
And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman—ground-up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?)
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (Yeah)
'Nother day in the life (Uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (Yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi (Say hi)
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (Way in the sky)
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya!
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit—tick, tick, tick—no remorse, pew!
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WIC—wick, wick, wick—with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?
[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 2]
Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice (Yeah)
Or you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of the tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your 'fuck it' switch, nothin' can compare
You might also like[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 3]
Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you ""Proof"" because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that inkling and mo–
–tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans that are two-faced didn't show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will
Do you still believe?335Embed"

It's another one

[Chorus]
I got that juice

Ooh, frozen like a cooler
Juice, blame it on my jeweler

I got stones on my neck (ooh)
Blood on my set (ooh)
Water on my wrist (drip)
Put glitter on my bitch (ju-juice)
My ex was a waitress
So I gave that hoe a tip (ooh)
My ex fucked a lame
Now she workin' double shifts (no juice)
Our money ain't the same
You a lame, and it clear (ooh)
I did ten mil in 11 months, not a year (juice)
I gave fifty racks in the club to appear (ju-juice)
I blew two mil on my dog for a appeal

I got that juice

She got that juice (ju-juice)

Eight years old, a couple cane poles
Sittin' down by the creek
Our lines in the water, watching those bobbers
Seein' that red sun sink
Mama's on the porch yelling ""Supper's hot
Y'all come and get it!""
We yelled five more minutes

[Verse 2]
At sixteen it was twelve o three
Standin' at her front door
Katie's dad said midnight
But we needed just a little more
Yellow light flipping on and off
Interruptin' that goodnight kissing
We wanted five more minutes
[Chorus]
Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those, Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes

[Verse 3]
At eighteen, turned my helmet in
And walked to the fifty-yard line
It's just the coach and me after we
Lost state, ten to nine
And I cried, ""Man next time to get in here
I'll have to buy a ticket""
Can't you give me five more minutes?

[Chorus]
Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
